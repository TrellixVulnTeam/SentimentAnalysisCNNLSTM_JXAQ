7,"I was disappointed because the name is misleading. The course provides a good introduction & overview of the responsibilities of the CTO, but has very little specifically digital content. It deals with two-speed IT in a single short lecture, so of course the treatment is superficial. It is easy to find more in-depth material freely available, on the McKinsey website for example.",3
13,"Good content, but the course setting does (at least for me) not allow learn the content long term due to missing reading material.",3
19,"The course content is quite good, though it could have been deeper in some areas.But its peer review system is not working well, if at all.Regards, An Le.",3
48,I'll start by saying that this course gives a good insight into a wide variety of applications of 3D printing. There are lots of interviews with people who have or are leveraging additive manufacturing in original and effective ways. The last week of the course also introduces an interesting and seemingly effective framework for design thinking.The reason that I've only rated 3 stars however is that the only useful thing you learn in this course is the design thinking framework. I think that it would be better if these videos were scattered throughout the rest of the specialisation. I do see value in including this material in the specialisation but not as an outright course.,3
52,It should be merged with course 1,3
60,Full Individuals speaking,3
61,It should be less repetitive and full of useful informations about applications.,3
64,it could be easily compressed in a two-weeks course.Sometimes interviews are too long for what they need to explain.,3
65,good introduction into the applications of 3D printing.,3
67,This session was too long and a little boring. Could be shorter with the related contents.,3
110,Not according what I expected,3
142,good introduction to 3D printing,3
176,Good information but way too short for what Coursera charges.,3
193,"The course itself is good. Nevertheless, it says that it doesn't require any previous experience... But there is actually experience required on financial statements and concepts.",3
199,"I love the professors, but unfortunately, I do not feel much connection to me (not really seeing so much importance for me to identifying if a company is making fake financial statements; I am not an investor, and my everyday work does not really have so much to do with financial statements).The Managerial Accounting (week 4) transforms my mindset!! I really appreciate that. That one single week of course can literally help so many companies/NGOs. That week 4 should be promoted more!!",3
209,"The first three weeks focussed heavily on ratios and detecting fraud and earnings management in an organization, the fourth week seemed to actually relate to data analytics and how non-financial aspects of a company play a role in the financial outcomes. I really do not see where a data analyst who is not in accounting field would be using the fraud detection scenarios in real life. A data analyst would be focused on improving the business and doing the analyses that pertain to improving certain aspects of a business, not finding his manager's earnings management using an M-score etc.",3
232,difficult for people without accounting background to take.,3
248,"Sorry to say but among the four courses of this specialization, this one really disappointed me. Not the fault of teachers or institute, i think the only mistake they made is try to fit too many topics in one course. Anyway this is only my opinion!",3
253,Great content but animations are annoying!,3
254,"With my Accounts/Business/Finance/Statistics Graduation/Post Graduation Education and Teaching & Work Experience, I believe the Professor/Educator who Designed and Presented this Course requires atleast a Basic Training before putting together an important Course like Accounting Analytics.",3
267,Prof Brian Bushee is really excellent but I felt that Prof Chris Ittner's lecture was quite fluffy for an analytics course. Would have appreciated practice problems and case study practices like the operation analytics class,3
302,"I would add more examples on how to populate the data, even spend time on optional videos where the professor or his assistant goes through testing ratios (something similar to Operations Analytics). I feel like the professor was rushing through his explanations and the models. Maybe people found the course very useful however I felt like there was too much text and immediate switch to Excel file that was elaborated shortly. Overall, I am not sure how to apply these ratios in my final project...",3
311,"I liked it, although I felt like they were 2 courses: One for the first three weeks, another one during the last week.The ""First Course"" was OK, but it was regular accounting stuff. I was rusty on that so I enjoyed it.The ""Second Course"" was the one related with Analytics.I give it 3 Stars because you can see some lack of preparation in the team. And because didn't made a proper link between Accounting and Analytics.",3
321,"It's ok. Bushee is very knowledgeable and a very enthusiastic teacher, but his lessons are too dense compared to the content in the rest of the Wharton BA programs. I actually like all the detail, but I think it's covered too quickly and the course should probably be made longer to deal with it all. There are ratios and balance sheet jargon just flying at you at a breathless pace. It would be better to focus on a few key ones and then walk through the examples a little more slowly. The quizzes were extremely tricky with too many choose more than one answers. It was difficult to find the parts of the video to review missed questions because 1) the transcripts are machine generated and make it difficult to search specific words and 2) it's difficult to remember where the concept was covered because there was so much in each video.The last week felt very disconnected from the first week and like it belonged in a different course almost. It was pretty good, though. I liked how it contained specific examples and charts.",3
322,Great introduction to Accounting Analytics. Unexpected lecturing dialogues. Could have more analytics or additional or optional problem sets to explore more deeply.,3
335,While I like the content of the course but I felt too much of topics were crammed into one single course. I had to struggle a lot to grasp the concepts on advanced algorithms by just relying on video lectures so I had to look around in the internet for additional resources. Nonetheless it was a satisfying experience though it took me a lot of time and effort to complete the assignments.,3
342,"easy to undestand, but it needs more examples",3
346,"I personally think that I've learnt more from Google and YouTube then in this course. You can join the course for certification. Other then the certificate, I find this course not much of value.",3
396,I did not understand the submitting process till the fourth week. I feel that you could have offered a more detailed description . Doing the review in the fourth week did not do justice for my peers.,3
443,"It's amazing that we live in an age where you can take online classes like this for free.I went from not knowing my way around Ableton to being able to make simple tracks in a few weeks.The course load is pretty light, but it makes it easy to stay motivated and keep up from week to week.The instructor has her quirks, but don't we all. I feel like this course is great for introducing someone who has prior experience with writing music and using DAWs to Ableton Live. However, for someone who already knows the basics of Live, this probably won't be of too much use.",3
492,"This particular module (week 3) is written for those students who are already have at least a nodding acquaintance with the software.The videos move so fast that I am not able to detect what is going on. Please believe me when I say that I run a copy of Fusion 360 at the same time as a particular instructional video is playing. I toggle from one to another, taking notes from the instructional video when possible. Still, it takes me weeks, not days, to understand what the professor is doing.It is true that there are several online tutorials with regard to using the sketch tools contained within Fusion 360. I have been reviewing the tutorials that I am able to find -- and I have learned quite a bit of ""how-to"" information that this particular module does not provide.Why is it that some of us who are new to the Fusion 360 environment have come to understand that we need to spend hours of our time to ""fill in the blanks"" of week 3?Are we to keep searching other sources so that we can learn what has not been taught in Week 3? If so, why?Bill Clark",3
495,"The instructor does an excellent job, but realistically there is no way to be proficient enough in a 3D software program after a week or two to earn a certificate. The certificate is worthless in my opinion. I liked the class but it seemed more like intro vs. a class of any proficiency required.",3
557,"The topics are really interesting and advanced! However, there's a lot of talk in chinese, due to questions/answers from teacher and students, and the quizzes are a bit too easy. I learned a lot though.",3
643,I knew nothing about Jefferson before this course and nothing about his 'age' - not sure I am much the wiser about the latter after it! I enjoyed the tours round the historic sites and I thought the lecturer came over as warm and enthusiastic but it seemed he was preaching about a saint rather than giving a detached academic assessment of a historical figure and I found that it was hard to see the wood for the trees at times. Hagiographic might be an unkind description but it was certainly very respectful to the great man. I also liked the use of a student in cooperation with the lecturer.- he set the scene well and was a good interviewer.,3
691,Ambiguous assignments led to cumbersome completion. The peer grading got a little annoying as sometimes it took forever to get feedback and a lot of times feedback was minimal or the criteria for grading was vague and people took it WAY too seriously.,3
710,"Very tough, though very instructive.",3
738,"The course was really great! The teacher explained excellent and the topics were very appropiate. However, when i finished the course i couldn't see the certificate of accomplishment at least; it never showed up :( And now when i click on the option ""Buy the course"" the page redirects me to an address which doesn't exist.Despite of this, I enjoyed this course a lot, as the first one! Thanks a lot!",3
752,"Actually, the course should be titled as ""Introduction Into Macroeconomics"", I think. The course is fine, but I won't call it really ""advanced"" one. The structure and topic list is okay, but the depth is not enough to threat the course as ""advanced"".",3
757,"Honestly, for something that says ""Advanced"" in the title, I thought it was a little too basic. There isn't enough depth and a lot of it involves common sense. Perhaps a more case-study driven course would have been interesting with more qualitative, essay responses required rather than cut-and-dry multiple-choice.",3
759,"Overall, this is a good subject.However, some slides are not well organized.Many questions in assignment are too tricky.",3
782,"Nice addition to the ""Competitive Strategy"" course, although not as interesting and practical as the first part... Cases and current examples would have made this section much better.Prof. Tobias Kretschmer ... 5 starsCompetitive Strategy . . . 5 starsAdvanced Competitive Strategy ... 3 stars",3
809,"it is okay, not what I expected, but okay.",3
816,"The course is fine as far as content. My complaint is that there is no one to contact regarding papers or questions. You are left to the other students for your grading and assignment completion, meaning that some of your assignments can hang there for weeks before ever getting reviewed.",3
819,Not the course id think it would be.I learn less information than i d expect but these were still usefull information.,3
840,"It has good content, but there were missing classes to give more advices or clear any question students have, when grading peer review homeworks there were plenty of mistakes that would have been avoided if there were more video lectures or forums with teachers.",3
845,"I wasn't sure what to expect with the Advanced Writing course. Again, peer review was unnecessarily harsh because people don't understand the flexibility and nuance of writing, but it's definitely informative and has made me a more mature academic writer. This specialization is well worth it, for the videos alone. The instructor is clear and the videos are very concise.",3
879,"So far the topics are very interesting but the accent of the teacher is sooo difficult to follow and distracts me! Also, she is looking down to read all the time and this doesn't reflect her knowledge.",3
889,"before discussing genetic mutations occurred in Alzheimer disease that mentioned when discussing AIS, i think some refreshment about protein synthesis and the normal pattern that if disturbed by certain ways as mutations causes particular diseases.some arrangements of material needed to prevent information overlappinginteresting courses, go onthanks for your efforts dear professors",3
898,"Too much bla, bla, bla. Very slowly, very boring.",3
933,Provides a nice basis in understanding how economic principles are used to investigate agriculture production. Could provide a bit more of an economic foundation but the course is broad rather than deep.,3
962,"The professor is very good. However, pictures and graphics mean a thousand words. These lectures rely too much on words. It makes it how to visualize the concepts. Hope to see more pictures. Animation will be the best.",3
966,"I was glad to get exposure to famous algorithms through this class, but I don't feel like I really developed an intuition for reasoning about their runtime. The class was challenging, but mostly for the wrong reasons. I spent more time and energy pouring over the answers to tricky quizzes and having to implement algorithms exactly as described in the lecture notes rather than really truly learning. It also took me much longer than the 4-8 hours per week advertised to complete each week.",3
1007,It would be nice to see more examples especially were we have too many formulas. I still confused with probability.Also hadwritting isnt really helping. I am most of the time decoding scripts. In addition he is reading the formula at one moment and in around 3-4 seconds it appears on the screen. So I kind of listening him while trying to read what is happening on the screen. horrible experience.,3
1017,good in depth knowedge.,3
1032,The early part of the course does not make a compelling argument for why we need to analyse complexity. The lectures are interesting but not helpful for use in business.,3
1046,"The material was good, but I did notice a couple of lectures and in-course questions presented out of order. What really turned me off, however were quizzes. In weekly quizzes the first answer was always the right answer. In the final quiz most of the questions had the first answer as the right answer. Since randomizing the answers is so obvious and easy, I am really at a loss why the quizzes would be presented in this way.",3
1074,kind of boring and I am not learning how half this info is obtained or why it is relevant to real world chemistry,3
1140,Very interesting! I wish there is some animation film to explain the narative.,3
1179,A lesson with discussion about the question of quizz.,3
1206,"Ancient Greeks is brief overview of Greek civilization from about 1800 to 320 BC, starting with the Minoans of Crete and ending with the death of Alexander the Great. Prof. Andrew Szegedy-Maszak demonstrates great knowledge about the subjects, covering literature, government, and philosophy.Yet the course has two setbacks: 1) The professor stutters through the lectures, displaying his obvious discomfort being on camera; and 2) the overview is very expansive, so there isn't great study in any single theater of Greek civilization.There is, however, solid coverage. I also felt the chapter on the 4th cent. BC, done to address complaints about no coverage of Alexander and Macedon, feels tacked on. It's a long, but somehow hurried lecture.That said, I liked this course. I gained greater knowledge of important political and literary figures, such as Solon and Alcibiades, than I did when I studied the subject back in college.",3
1271,"I must say I feel disappointed especially when the whole Data Structures and Algorithms series take this course as the selling point ( ""you'll learn how to compute the fastest route between New York and Mountain View thousands of times faster than classic algorithms and close to those used in Google Maps"", blablabla), but it turns out to be the least challenging course with only elementary introduction to the big topic. Perhaps the preparing time for this course is too short? I still miss the teaching style and assignment design of the first course of the series though. It would seem to be unwise to pay for the following courses if this continues on.(FYI I was the among the first ones who take this series, and I have got 100% grade for each course ever since then.)",3
1310,"Even though there is a lot of useful information in this course, I personally don’t like it. I wouldn’t take this course again if I had a chance to go back in time.All hometasks are much more about programing in Java than algorithms. Open any week's discussion forum, you will find out that 90% questions and problems are about Java, not algorithms. If you are not a professional programer, you will spend at least 30-40 hours a weak instead of 6-10 hours.5 week’s task is just a pure joke: 30 minutes explanation about most difficult structure in the course and not a single line of code.. After that you must write it by yourself. Just look at week 5 discussion forum. Do you know why there are 42 topics in week 3 and only 7 in week 5? Because people decide not to do it.The goal of a teacher must be to make students love the course\matherial\science, not to hate it. I’m not sure about hating, but it was annoying as hell.",3
1319,"Topics are interesting, explanation is boring",3
1512,"Good course for a free one. Thank you for all of your great work. Somehow, the pace is too fast. Covering about 2 sections per week is by far too hard to read the book along with the class. There's no practice exercise to strengthen what you learn. The assignment is very hard and sometime don't directly implement the knowledge you learn in that week. Sometime the video sound is too quiet (but you can read the transcript when it happened.) The book is better in my opinion.",3
1558,Ha sido un curso muy interesante y útil. Lo recomiendo para saber como América Larina funciona en estos momentos. Los documentos adjuntos son extremadamente necesarios para disfrutar del curso!It was so interesting and useful. I recomend it to know about how Latin America is working at this moment. The attached files are extremly needed to enjoy the course!,3
1560,"videos can be more interactive with more information on the slides. feel that slides downloaded is not worth the time. I seem to see the professor on screen more then important information we need to take note of. Some modules need to go indepth explanation but does not, especially on",3
1594,Why were we talking about money managers and hedge funds? What does that have to do with data analytics for business? I never saw the connection and they never explained it.,3
1595,"This was a good introductory course, with some very informative video and instruction. I only give it 3 stars because I felt it really lacked interactivity. Although quizzes were required throughout, I felt too much of the class was simply sitting back and watching lectures.",3
1607,Content was a bit shallower than expected.,3
1636,Good intro,3
1647,"Interesting enough, good start to the specialization but not the most content for a standalone course.",3
1672,Survey course. Excited to apply the knowledge and learn concrete skills in the upcoming courses within this specialization.,3
1673,It's very general information. The explanation movies are great.,3
1686,"This was a very basic foundation course on data careers and business metrics. Gives a lot of examples of companies and their varying levels of need for data employees. There is a short segment in here on Financial services which i found to be a bit misplaced, and I would have liked more detail on the business metrics side as well as on the financial services side (if it is indeed well placed and I just didn't catch the correlation).",3
1692,good but the tests can be better planned.,3
1694,"Very good course, only 1 BIG disadvantage: you cannot take the quizzes unless you buy the certificate...",3
1706,"Pretty good overview for simple business metrics definitions and basic level analysis. It is a good refresher for those with an analytics background, but also puts things in a perspective from a business setting which is good for when you are working in the field.",3
1718,"I thought that they could have gone more in depth in terms of metrics, how to calculate them, and use them in real life situations. The course seemed to focus too much on the type of companies that use data, as well as what type of jobs there are in this field. I didn't find it too relevant or helpful in terms of making me more productive at work.",3
1757,"The lectures are good and clear, with many concrete examples and exercices to train. The topic itself is a little limited, mostly to finance, whereas there would be so much more equally interesting diversity in data to analyse. I just don't dream of money all the time.The course limitations for free attendance get in the way of efficient learning though, using cheap tricks to manipulate you into buying, though I haven't seen these features used this way in other curses, I bet they're using what they teach to increase conversion using any way available.",3
1760,"The course content is good. However, by the review assigment i can see that the concepts were not clear, ther",3
1762,"I feel like more examples, case studies, or panel interviews would help.",3
1776,"It's a great introductory course, although a bit superficial.",3
1780,Very basic terms. Not very helpful for later concepts and would not recommend for business professionals that have experience,3
1789,"A lot of time devoted to the job stuff may not be super relevant for most students, and was certainly not super relvant too.",3
1798,I had a hard time finding material to study.I wish the class had more reading material.,3
1799,A very useful course for budding professionals. Wouldn't recommend this to middle managers / data experts.,3
1807,Good introduction to the Theme. Some subjects was not entirely connected between weeks.,3
1818,"I found this course interesting, but a bit too simple.From the answers of other students that I marked many are non-native speakers of English who hadn't really understood the questions.",3
1819,"I would have liked the course to have been more hands on. I would have also liked to have seen other platforms utilized.Ex:Hypothetical situations to apply course content to.Group assignments with real time chat.Better formatted supplemental readings to compliment the lecture videos.Also, I feel like the instructors failed to explain some of the business jargon used, which wasn't remedied by referencing the dictionary.",3
1824,Great introduction to the Subject,3
1828,"Good introduction to business metrics. I was less enthusiastic about all the investment metrics and formulas, but that might just be me.",3
1836,"good, but no material and lack of structure",3
1847,Solid introduction - slightly disjointed and fairly boring presentation.,3
1890,"Good course for those with limited exposure to business metrics. Would be more valuable to include 5 or 6 standard Key Performance Indicators (KPI's) by function (marketing, sales, operations, finance), etc. that will be typically encountered in an advanced undergraduate or MBA program.",3
1900,The course title is a bit misleading. There were too much math in the course.,3
1906,The course for me was very simple and basic. I recommend it to students who makes their firs steps in this area.,3
1909,Meh. It was just okay.,3
1964,"The class is a pretty nice overview of metrics in general. it is more broad than it is deep, and sometimes the videos and explanations were not the most easily digested. While the content was helpful, this class could have been greatly improved if slides were provided instead of just a transcript. Finally, some of the explanations and definitions, though interesting, weren't often well tied together. The final assignment case study was definitely useful in thinking about several of the metrics covered over the four weeks.",3
1965,not much is taught here but I guess should be a good beginning for the specialization.,3
1983,"It's OK, I think there's a few areas that could use some more depth of explanation. As with a few coursera courses there seems to be an assumption that students know the material being discussed and so it isn't explained. Most of the time in this unit that isn't the case but it does occur a bit.",3
1992,"Sometimes it seems very ""mechanic"". The instructor is clearly reading a script.",3
2010,"I found the lectures marginally useful. The instructor may know what he is talking about but takes a rather unstructured approach to articulating it. Having come from a business background and going into BI full-time, I was seeking novel ways to evaluate business performance. The glossary cheatsheets delivered on this best - but the videos I found to have simple, tired repeated perspective. It could be more useful if you have no business background whatsoever.",3
2011,"In my opinion this course is superficial. I didn't get real knowledge from it. At the same time this course might be just an intro to the series of courses about Business Analytics. So I'm looking forward to try them all!Anyway, thanks for the course!",3
2081,reviewed. good course.,3
2087,"This course provided a good introduction to SQL for me as a beginner and through challenging lessons forced me to learn SQL basics. After Week 3 however, I found that the level of difficulty increased steeply and not enough assistance was provided in the lessons to get through the course at a reasonable pace. In addition to providing answers to each week's exercises, further review of how the answer was obtained and the breakdown of the logic behind it would be helpful.",3
2094,The course structure was well formatted. The order of the lessons and content presented made for learning intuitive. The follow along practice queries and end of lesson practice problems were also helpful interactives for the student.However there were mistakes in the answer keys or practice problem prompts that became more frequent in the lessons towards the end of the course. This made it difficult to practice the more complicated material and queries. It was also a big time waster when as a student you were unsure whether you were answering the correct question and if so whether your answer was correct. It would also been helpful to have more open ended practice problems at the end of the course in addition to the set provided.Finally I think this course would be better split into two parts. The first part should be geared towards querying data and focusing more on just pulling data and intermediate queries. The main audience would be analyst/data professionals that have privileges to pull data but not modify data. The second part of the course would be more useful to DBAs or professionals that have database admin privileges to insert/delete/modify data. I would also focus more heavily on database schemas in this second course relative to the first.,3
2106,"there are so little video tutorials, and too many exercises without video instructions.",3
2201,"The video instruction are not as helpful as I wished. They were too brief, and all the learning end up with doing the exercises. The regular exercises and the quizzes use different database system, and it sometimes hard to transfer what you learn to the quizzes.The pre-quiz exercises are more helpful imo, but no answer key is provided. Sometimes I am still confused even after passing the quiz.",3
2209,It's a good class and I learned a lot. The learning curve shoots up exponentially around the fourth week. I could see this course being perfect if broken down into two classes.,3
2212,too many issues with the DB's that needed to be accessed to complete the exams.,3
2286,Did not like that I have to upgrade just to take a quiz,3
2316,Worth skimming fast through for free to learn a little something about the brain. Don't expect to learn much about the brain though. The title is a little misleading.,3
2319,"Well, I expected more and more debt, It seems the course is oriented to the general public.",3
2320,"The course satisfied me in various aspects. It is brief and clear. Thank you for our instructor for nice presentations.Nevertheless, I would expect more about pharma and treatment apporaches. More about drugs available in the markets and new trends.Psychotherapy applications / demonstrations would be very useful.",3
2328,Knowledgeable professor. Distracting background. I prefer direct eye contact rather than having the professor sometimes filmed not looking directly at the camera. But the course gave excellent information and I enjoyed it.,3
2333,"Course give very good information, but the ""The addicted brain"" its not the correct name.Second part of the course give more detail information about different drugs and body biology, but its not directly related to the Brain.However, the training its very good, just change the label.",3
2341,"So simple, not enough informative.",3
2357,Maybe too easy... And too focused on the society more than on the brain itself. Enjoyed it though.,3
2378,Interesting but really introductive,3
2387,"Maybe because I am a med graduate already I expected much more from this course. It was ok, but my impression was always like there was too much of talking what important stuff is going to be discussed, but not really the facts themselves. I would rather learn more practical knowledge. Anyway I learnt some new things as well.",3
2395,Very interesting as lay person interested in topic.,3

2441,I will rated number 3 because I want to learn more new stuff about protections of my body.,3
2473,Not enough Tableau use for it to be in the title of the course,3
2508,"I will start with you do learn a lot from the videos (and the stuff you learn is very valuable), it's the absence of staff or professor involvement that is a problem and why I am not giving 5 stars. Outside of quizzes which are graded by computers, your ""practice"" assignments (which aren't practice because you can't check your answers before a test, super awesome when you can't really ask for help), final project and forum questions are graded or answered by other students.If you have any confusion, either it will go unresolved or be worsened by potentially wrong answers from other students which I saw happen many, many times. Maybe I am expecting too much from an online learning platform? In all, I feel like while I did learn, I perhaps learned some wrong practices too. So while the videos are great, the actual teacher involvement is poor.Coursera - I am not sure how you and the university work together, but is it totally strange to desire some input from your professor?",3
2535,"I loved this course. The lecture videos taught me a lot and I was happy I got to use whatever I learned in the final project. The only reason why I'm giving three stars was because of the submission process for the final project. It gave me a headache because I didn't really understand how to submit to Tableau public. I tried following the instructions but I couldn't find some things so it confused me a bit. It caused me to submit my assignment late, and it was just not a pleasant process. Maybe upload new instructions with screenshots, or make another lecture video on how to submit.",3
2536,I have given an extra star for the free license software received.Didn't find the course as challenging as the Machine Learning course.The assignments need to be more challenging. Connecting to SQlite / GA Analytics dummy data can be added. Tableau with R session can be incorporated.,3
2554,"Great course!Very well organized, and worked in a format where you would build as you learned and had several milestones for review.The one complaint I have is that the final asks for you to work in Tableau, and provides you a license for 15 days, although the course runs longer than that.",3
2668,"It's a good course by the standards of when it was made which, going by the overview, looks like 2014. the lectures are based on eclipse while the video teaches how to install android studio. Some of the examples are not compatible with Android studio and work only on eclipse. Being updated with the more recent material would've helped more. Having said that, the teaching style is really conducive to learning for newbies. It's a good introduction to the world of Android development.",3
2708,I like this programme its very helpful and encouraging for me to do programming,3
2726,"I was very excited during Week 1 and Week 2 lectures. Then, the videos kept getting unclear and outdated. The assignment is not engaging. My interest dropped. The videos really need updates!",3
2729,Overall I think the course was good. This course requires you to do a lot of self study and research on every single topic. It only covers the very basic and core topics. I would have liked it to have more hands on or practical examples.,3
2745,"While this course is interesting and informative, I was hoping that there would be a larger portion dedicated to jobs, industries, and ideas that help make the world a better place. I was hoping that by the end of this course, I would have learned about many more options on how to act now, today, as opposed to such a strong emphasis on the origin and meaning of ethics.",3
2786,"Previous courses in this series was better. This iteration is very ""paint-by-numbers"", much of the material, conclusions, format, is already prepared in advance.",3
2808,Not a simple class,3
2827,The course provides a concise overview of the disorder and suggests some strategies to cope with it at home and in school. I found it a bit too short and too simple.,3
2839,"It's not professional as that one created by Penn Uni. Named ""Pay attention "" which is unavailable now and I don't understand why has it been removed from Coursera?!!",3
2854,Some content on quizzes wasn't covered in the videos,3
2872,I am working as an organisational consultant and thought this would add some knowledge - however it is really difficult to follow because it seems repetitive to me... I have paid for the certificate and still it is difficult for me to focus. It seems there is too much information and too much talk for things that are easily understood and do not need all this going over and over again. I got bored by the time I got to week 3 and it is seems impossible to stay focused and complete all assignments. I hope this changes in my third and last chance to get the certificate...,3
2873,I rated this as a 3 though I got a lot more out of the concepts and the class in the way it was taught than I had when reading books and literature on the subject. I would have wanted more discussions with cohorts taking the class to help cement the practices by virtue of seeing it from other perspectives in different work environments. I can imagine the same class with a moderator and someone facilitating the discussions would get me to the 5 rating. In a nutshell the content is great the experience of the class could be at a higher level then what I experienced.,3
2877,Despite the material being interesting the instructor's way of teaching it made it boring and hard to pay attention,3
2896,Well structured courseCourse material download as a summary would be great (PPT/PDF),3
3033,"decent course overall, but problem solutions are much missed. even after completing the course perfectly i'm still not sure how I got some answers.for example: ""approximate f^(72)(0) of cos(x^3). I figured the way to solve it, but I hove no idea why it is solved that way.",3
3035,"The effort put for explanation by Dr. Fowler is extraordinary. However the course needs to show more of the 'connection between steps' when stating a theorem for convergence tests.This current version of calculus is a bit disappointing, earlier the practice problems were solved in steps.",3
3076,"Lots of random details that the professor seems to have missed make the course difficult because you end up spending hours debugging random, irrelevant things.",3
3088,"During this course I had many issues with bower and version conflicts. I do everything step by step like in the video, and nothing works. I look at error log and realize there is some issue with versions. =\It would be really nice if you explained how to deal with it, instead of making me waste hours of my time on googling this stuff. It almost made me quit using bower forever.",3
3111,We need Angular 2,3
3131,"Overall pretty good, but I think maybe the course ought to be extended a week or so to really take time and look at descriptions of the tasks run in the task runners. The angular content is pretty good and helpful, though.",3
3133,"Should update to Angular 2, or at least revise some exercises to include code for Angular 1.6.. and keep track properly of when gulpfile should be updated!",3
3140,"Exercise sources are not up to date, I have come across many problems.",3
3155,Definitely Not for young new front end learners .Lots of things difficult to understand.,3
3160,This was a hard course and many of the exercises did not have enough details to complete the assignments on time. I had to rely on course forums and a lot of googling to finish the course successfully.,3
3161,"Many errors appeared doing exercises, material needs to be updated - many node modules already deprecated. Also it'll be better if teacher more clarify all the actions he doing. Sometimes he did something not clear and there was no answer what is happening and why in this way.",3
3165,This course is not for javascript beginners. You should come in with solid understanding of the language - probably more than you would get from the first two courses of this program.,3
3166,"A bit outdated now, however it is still a good resource to get started.",3
3194,"it is good , but some items needs to be illustrated in more details , a great thing of this course is that it gives a lot of practice exercises",3
3204,I am a bit disappointed by this course. I was expecting a more fast paced course with more information regarding Angular. Unfortunately in the videos there is a lot of time spent on unnecessary details and reading out loud the source code. The exercises are quite basic and they did not pose real challenges - except for errors coming from mismatched packages or mistakes in configuration files. Also I think that the level of support provided by the mentors of this course is lacking. Mentors are quite absent and very late in providing any help in the forums so the students have to kind of counsel one another - that is sometimes good but a proper class also requires a good level of supervision.All in all I think this is an OK course that is mostly geared to the uninitiated. It needs some serious work to make it a great course.,3
3232,The course was just fine. Some of the lectures were really good while some lectures were really confusing. The good thing is that course provides excellent resources for further exploring the topics in the course. So i had to consult these additional resources when i find lectures confusing.Course Assignments were really simple. Hardly any assignment took me more than an hour to complete.,3
3245,"Overall the course is very good but it gets trickier the further you go, specially if you have no experience in this area whatsoever... Take it from someone who's first contact with Web Development was the first course in this Specialization: ""HTML, CSS & JavaScript"". My advice to students in a similar situation is to look for other sources of information as well and try to experiment with your code as the lessons go by so you can really grasp the meaning of the pieces of code you're writing. Eventually, they'll start to make sense :-)",3
3276,Everything is explained in a big rush. Very hard to get starting from the second week,3
3279,"A massive amount of content to cover, some of it quite advanced.The exercises become fraught if your code is out of sync with the tutor's code. Things won't work, you won't know why, and there's no real recovery from that.",3
3290,"A whole lot of information to absorb, that I will definitely agree with! If there was anything I wish went into more detail, there would be two things.1) Yo / Yeoman: This part of the course was more of an ""Obligatory"" lecture, just to say it's mentioned. I watched that one video many times over, but still ended up going to YouTube for actual ""training"" on the ins and outs. I know time is constrained in MOOC's and you don't get the full load of knowledge you would in a traditional school. However, my thoughts are that either give us an exercise so we can at least have that as experience in using it, or just remove it completely. The lecture was put together as a sort of ""Follow Along"", but it really felt rushed and more of an ""Obligatory"" thing than an actual lesson.2) Give us more detail on the difference between Services and Factories. Keep in mind that I still have Multi-Platform Mobile App Development, and Server Side Development with Node.js still to go, so I don't know if these are explained more in those courses. As it stands right now, I -still- don't know the difference between a factory and a service, or even what a provider is. When should I use a factory? When should I use a service? Which is better suited for what task? All those questions I do not have an answer for after this course, which feels a bit short for me.",3
3316,"This course is deceivingly full of content. If you want to get through this course you need to have a lot of time on your hands because of the shear amount of debugs your code will produce even if you follow the steps to the letter. So many things are taught over a 4 week period that if you do not do the extra reading to understand what is happening you will get an overview of angularjs, bower, gulp, grunt, yo, yeoman and so on without really knowing how to use any of these tools again. Also because of the number of interdependent parts to the application you create, when the professor decides to give you one of the html or js files again to do an assignment, chances are everything will break and you will spend a long time figuring out which variables' names have been changed and blabla...The professor does not give you a good basis for debugging your code, you need to modify the set up of gulp to show understandable stack traces to figure out what is going wrong.If you want a challenging course where you have to go the extra mile learning things from documentation and blogs to substitute the lack of detail in order to complete the course, than this is the course for you!I think this course needs to be restructured and the length increased to 6 weeks instead of 4, with more detailed content and understand of each tool and especially more on angularjs",3
3352,Pity that people had to spend more time on making the plugins work than actually doing the exercises/assignments but good content nonetheless.,3
3368,"This course is good only for newbies and very high-level. No advanced info about Angrular. No tricks. No info about custom directives, $watch, digest cycle, etc. I had expected more detailed course",3
3404,steps for exercises are not clear.,3
3437,"Although a good introduction course, sometime is focus on javascript tools rather than on AngularJS itself which, in hand, looses time and doesn't explain/give examples on how to create directives and filters, which are two core functionalities of this framework.",3
3451,"Amount of AngularJS topics covered by the course is too small. All assignments are very typical, just copy-paste from lecture exercises.",3
3512,"I was able to grasp the overview of the course. The instructions are delivered well and the flow seems in order. However my lack of background with the topic discussed cause me to stop watching everything. Plus, I can't do the said assignment because I am a beginning on this topic. it seems this is not a course for me to rate based on content. However I will rate it in terms of the aesthetic, organization or structure of the slides .The organization of the content of the slides needs to be properly organized. Long paragraphs are a pain to read. Further when comparing, two concepts, it is easier to comprehend when they are in table form. For instance in FrontEnd JavaScript Framework Overview video, it is better in terms of organization and aesthetic to show library vs. framework in table form.Also, the volume of Introduction to AngularJS video is too loud. Though I can adjust it and lower the volume, but sudden high volume sound is discouraging when the next video has normal volume causing me to adjust it again.I was only able to watch few of the videos but they are good. Just a little improvement needed.",3
3566,So So.Not good to learn an algorithm,3
3576,The last 2 lessons did not have much content. Particularly there was no practical assessment on traveling salesman,3
3588,"The first 3 weeks are really good, 5 stars. Weeks 4 and 5 are way too light. Week 4 has no programming assignment and a short class and 5 has a weak programming assignment and no class.",3
3601,Introduction to data structures. It wastes a week talking about theoretical complexity when it could have been used for something more productive.,3
3659,"learning graph with Java while reviewing varieties of java advanced data structure. in a word, help me a lot.",3
3668,"There is not enough background information, no reading assignments. This makes the course less understandable. Also, the examples given not related to the stated assignment",3
3675,"Compared to the previous 2 courses, this one seemed to have been made in rush. Not enough materials covered, nor enough Java practice opportunity. The course title is misleading because it does not cover any other data structures but graph.",3
3679,Felt like it was a bit rushed and some of these concepts like Dijkstra definitely deserve a lot more attention.,3
3688,Not really related to the specialization.,3
3690,"I liked pretty this course. I learnt some useful skills and tactics in order to develop a negotiation. As a negative point, I found lack of examples so that understand better the theoretical issues as well as to remember better.",3
3724,Generally a good course about the very basics of hardware. It also has a nice introduction to the very basics of C Programming.,3
3744,"This is a good introduction course. But!But, I don't think it's worth to pay 61 dollar for a couple of hours of lectures, that you can finish during 1 day.I'm really disappointed with the fact, that it's not possible to go through quizes and assignments without payment. What if I can't pay right now, but will be able to pay at the end to receive my certificate? I should go through the course again and I will be late for all assignments, so will have to wait for another course session... Very-very inconvenient.And, yep, coursera reduce the effect of learning with not providing quizes for those who are auditing only.",3
3760,Basic progamimg understanding / interacting with Arduino,3
3765,The professor seems pretty nice and the class is great but even quizzes/answers and assignments are only available for payment,3
3773,Prefer more challenging course on this topic.,3
3778,"It can be nice to walk through this process with a lecturer. Ian Harris does it well and knows the content well enough.Most of this content however is given sufficiently in the pamphlet with the Arduino Uno Starter Kit. Some problems and applications above and beyond the starter kit's intro guide would be nice and appropriate for the course. Additionally, given that this is also supposed to be an intro to C, a bit more detail and some programmatic problem solving in C would have also added good value to the course.",3
3790,"Very basic overview of the Arduino system. Was expecting to be a bit more comprehensive. However, the final module is worthwhile, even if you know a little arduino programming.This course is baby steps to Arduino programming.",3
3803,More detailed insight of topics is required is what I felt. On the whole a great resource to the student community who want to start their microcontroller exploration through Arduino.,3
3810,"Good , but not very detailed for programming the Arduino",3
3826,"The interface of the classes is too straight, not very flexible. It almost looks like a real classroom, which isn't good in case we're at home learning by ourselves. Still, it has a very good content.",3
3849,This great course and greate insturactor,3
3853,not a great amount of content,3
3855,It was good but according to me it had a paucity of arduino programming for which i enrolled . However it was still helpful and i enjoyed it .,3
3881,i expected it to be more advanced.,3
3899,good as a start,3
3917,"On one hand - basics. On the other, you may be lost in the last part of the course. You don't need to understand to complete assigements, but netherless - it's hard to understand if you do not have experience in embedded systems topic",3
3927,"As I was taking this class, I often wondered who the target audience was. Although the class has no listed prerequisites, I noticed a lot of engineering jargon being used without ever defining what it meant. I'm not sure that non-technical people would get much out of the lectures. On the other hand, the lectures were mostly at a superficial level, so I'm not sure that technical people would get much out of them either. The only topic that got a (somewhat) deep dive was serial communication, and it wasn't clear why; users of the Arduino don't need to understand it any more or less than any other aspect of how an Arduino works.There were other issues. The programs we wrote had to be pasted into a submission form that removed all the carriage returns when you hit Save; I had to manually fix my program each time. Perhaps most frustratingly, you could follow the assignment instructions to the letter, but after you submitted you might find out that the grading criteria included other requirements. In one case people asked about it, and it turned out that the grading criteria were wrong, but they were never updated. My sense was that not much effort went into the creation of this course.",3
3959,No practical at least till the end of this course in this specialization,3
3967,"expected more programs to be taught and more experiments to be shown, disappointing",3
4039,"This class gets very math and theory heavy, so I would not recommend it for those looking for programming practice with the algorithms/programming approaches presented in this class. If you want thorough theoretical background information, this class would be a better fit.The use of RNA secondary structure alignment as an example of dynamic programming implementation is overkill. There are much simpler ways to introduce dynamic programming.",3
4076,"This course has amazing information in the lectures, but it is difficult in the video lectures to pick out what bits of information are going to be relevant in the quizzes, you will have to re-take quizzes a number of times, no matter how well you are taking notes. Also the very last section is entirely made of a rushed-maths lesson, and a quiz based on that rushed maths lesson that is VERY difficult. I would highly recommend this for anyone who already knows basic Astronomy Math, and caution anyone who doesn't.",3
4083,interesting course but you cant do the tests if you didnt pay money (any tasts),3
4117,"It is a very interesting course.The tasks are achievable and easy to follow.I do not understand how your final qualification depends on an activity qualified by fellow students, many of them, as the instructions read, are not fluent in English. How can they evaluate an activity written in such?",3
4173,WIsh there were more assignments. The final project was the only assignment in the course. Object-oriented programming in R requires more than a single assignment to grasp- even at a superficial level.,3
4174,"To complete this course you have to go back and forth for the basic. Also the final assignment is bit ambiguous, more clarity is required.",3
4183,"This course has a very clear goal. However, the implementation of this goal needs significant improvement. The first three modules were very easy to master. However, the last module was disproportionately difficult, making it unreasonable for learners.",3
4194,"The ideas are good, but I dislike the presentation. It's hard to read the screen and quotes when they're only on the screen for a few moments. Lengthy lists are presented, however, I need to pause the video if I want to know anything that's on the list beyond the first two points. These are often the only points explained. If one is only concerned with the spoken word, then you'll gather an okay amount of information.",3
4208,"Great as an introduction for many things but, unfortunately, it is not possible to keep on developing the themes presented on the lectures because there is no access to the sources used. Without a functional bibliography for the course, the full potential for learning of those enroled is tragically cut.",3
4224,"I wish this course was more focused on building and analyzing data in excel. It feels like it's more focused on financial measurements and probability, it hasn't related to my line of work yet.",3
4226,"Good Course, but final project asks a lot for what this course is",3
4228,"Leve of difficulty was above my expectations. Moved too fast. Could have been more thorough in applying the content to examples similar to the quiz. Seemed to stick to the bare minimum of what would be required before moving to the quiz. Be transparent with future prospective students that this course absolutely requires knowledge of calculus, probability, and statistics.",3
4251,Good material but short explanation and no detail exercises and solution practices before the final test makes the test a bite hard to resolve.,3
4266,"Though at the start of the program indicates no prerequisite I would suggest that you be familiar with Algebra and Stats. Most videos are of Dr. Egger writing out algebraic equations and discussing them, the excel component of Mastering data in excel come via pre-made calculators as attachments that you for the most part need to figure out on your own.If you do not have a good comfort level with stats then you will require more time to spend on understanding the spreadsheet and it’s use.It would be fantastic if Dr Egger could go through the spreadsheets as a part of the video and show a couple examples, hopefully revisions down the road !It was challenging but not impossible, and if you do not challenge yourself how much are you really learning?Best of luck!",3
4273,Course only drilled down on specific aspects of excel that were inclined to regression analysis which is just one aspect used in business analysis,3
4281,"nice syllabus overall with great exercises.wish it would teach more commonly used excel skills in business e.g. pivot tables, index-match, vlookup etc.lectures were a bit hard to follow (esp the mathy ones) - i'd suggest reworking the blackboard craft",3
4282,Very hard to comprehend for 6 weeks. But could have been great.,3
4293,Not so good. The course explains mathematical models and Excel applications but both are not detailed. There are many mistakes in PPTs and assignments.,3
4295,Getting more theoretical and less practical application on Excel application. Advanced Data interpretation and solving methods information can be included.,3
4299,The second test should be compulsory for also the non-paying students!,3
4301,"The instructor should spend more time putting equations and concepts into concept, and tying them together. It often felt like values and questions were arbitrary. This is less about master data analysis in Excel, and more about gaining ground in a few key concepts, so the title is misleading as well.",3
4306,This course is very challenging. I may not have had the proper background in mathematics to full absorb the material. Similarly I may have to busy of a lifestyle to have properly focused on this class.,3
4308,"It's more statistics than Excel itself, wich is good but I think the name doesn't fit to it",3
4309,inclination was more towards concept than excel,3
4319,The order and content of the lessons wasn't planned with sufficient care.,3
4321,Quiz does not require hands-on experience of creating templates but rather simply plugging in numbers. Students may forget most of the content after finishing the quiz.,3
4336,could have lecture more.... the videos talks little about the spreadsheet provided,3
4337,It's too advanced for people with no experience in statistics and sometimes too abstract to relate with,3
4341,Not so comfortable with using Excel.,3
4344,It was an interesting course.,3
4345,"The Course is fine, explanations and videos are a bit hard to follow at times.The final assessment is in my opinion very bad, as it i appears to me quite unrelated to the course it self. The lectures are quite abstract and the exam is a practical application of the concept.The instructions of the course also aren't very good as you need to do each part of the final project at the end of each week.I would strongly suggest to not take this course unless you have many spare hours.",3
4351,This course has a lot to do with math and statistics and I find it really hard to follow especially when it comes to the final project.,3
4366,"It was hard to follow along with the lessons, because it was mainly present in formulas. More examples might help students relate the information better.",3
4371,"This quickly became a statistics course, which although important was really difficult for me as I went in not expecting it.However, Dr. Egger is incredible! I think he's a fantastic and well-versed instructor in the Data & Analytics realm and am eager to find ways I can use what I've learned into practice at work.",3
4377,The class has great concept but it needs a bit more structure and change to hit its full potential.The Good:-The spreadsheets and exercises along with Quiz material. The project was also very informative.The Bad:- The video need to better explain how Area Under Curve and how the Credit model make sense. It was not very intuitive and I struggled for over 2 weeks to put the Project together due to this gap.But a worthwhile class with great potential. I am glad I took it.,3
4379,Not enough practices for the unexperienced students.,3
4380,The attendants might already have a good foundation of econometric and probability statistics before taking this course. Some definitions might be difficult to understand especially how it would be applied in real life.,3
4395,"Way too theoretical. This is Excel, not Information Theory....",3
4405,"The importance of this course is huge. However, I did miss better explanation from some topics...",3
4420,"This course did not live up to its potential.The course should be retitled as an ""Intro to Statistics"" not learning functions and visualizations on excel.I still have three stars because I at least picked up some useful concepts from it.",3
4421,Final project really hard,3
4428,This course was over my head academically and I was able to glean very little from it.,3
4430,Not so relevant with real work.,3
4435,"Great class, however I felt it was very heavy on statistics and math concepts versus how to use Excel for data analysis. I would've liked to see some strategies on how to analyze large datasets, look for trends, and clean up bad data.",3
4443,"good, but no material and lack of structure",3
4448,"It's quite interesting, but definitely not a beginners one. I'm put off quite a bit by the exclusively financial examples",3
4451,"I would like to have more example, it feels there is mostly theory. The quizzes were super easy, I dropped out at final project, I couldn't get through the first questions. The course (and especially the final project) requires a good basis in statistics beforehand.The assistants are super helpful and patient.",3
4454,still needs a better way of explaining the diversity of the course,3
4471,after the second week I droped this course...I thought it will include excel and economics knowledge but was very wrong..,3
4476,"This course is good, but I feel it's too difficult. It would be good to suggest 'optional' prerequisite course if there is any. Thanks Dr. Egger.",3
4493,"The later part of the sessions lacks practical applicability and it is more abstract, that I find difficult to relate",3
4498,"Course contents are rather deep which is good and makes it challenging. Explanations could be better and there should be more content on some topics for better understanding. Someone with background in statistics would find this course more useful than on who only has basic knowledge of statistics. Nevertheless, it inspired me to learn from other sources to fill the gaps in my understanding.",3
4502,"The course gives you interesting analysis tools, but the title suggests you are going to learn new Excel tools, and you actually use it at a very low level.",3
4505,"The whole course has very little about excel, rather about aweful a lot of data models. The course title is very misleading.",3
4520,Not much explanatory,3
4533,They have a lot of good material. It will probably be better the second time around.,3
4537,good course,3
4553,"Good intro and fundamentals, but focuses far too much on finance.",3
4558,Really interesting course and material and a very good instructor. This would be a 5 stars course if it wasn't for the final project. During lessons some concepts of statistics were taken as known (which is okay). However the final project required to utilize a combination of all new learned material on a whole different level of difficulty compared to the preceding quizzes. I did not expect that jump in difficulty and enjoyed the course a lot but the final project just was a struggle.,3
4561,"it is too complicated for me this courese, not very useful for daily work. but anyway i",3
4564,"The course has some valuable information, however course materials and videos are not so helpful. If you already have some knowledge about statistics and excel, it will be a lot easier to follow the instructor's lectures, otherwise I don't feel how a beginner could really follow up on this course. Some topics are run through so quickly that they are confusing to students.",3
4640,"Good course, gently showing an introduction. Had the playspeed at 1.25x the entire time though, otherwise they talked too slow.",3
4678,"Very interesting material and well explained, but videos are quite plain - borderline boring.",3
4888,"Thanks for providing lots of interesting materials! As for me, i would prefer having more advanced tests and tasks as the given ones did not really help me remember the materials. I would also appreciate having some additional materials on the brain areas in this course, since this area was completely new to me.",3
5008,"The course content was very interesting, however, the way it was presented was very dull and monotonous. The script was great - very insightful and informative, but having the presenter talk for the whole lecture without more frequent use of diagrams, figures, etc. to help understand the concepts is not helpful and incomprehensible to me. Specially when it comes to a course with so much geographical content, it would be good to have a more consistent depiction of maps. Furthermore, with all the new concepts, visual aid would help students understand what things are and what they look like since the backgrounds chosen for the lectures have little or nothing to do with the course whatsoever.On the other hand, I do think that the questions throughout the videos are extremely useful as they (usually) tackle problems that were not mentioned previously and gets the student to think independently. Finally, the end of lesson tests always have one or two challenging questions which is great. This course has a 5 star potential, so I hope the reviews are being read so they can work towards that goal!",3
5026,There is a very technical portion to this class making it difficult for the neophyte to truly understand and explain course content.,3
5035,"I am new to statistics and found most of the lessons difficult to understand, although I did pass the course and had taken the first two courses of the specialization before. More exercises would help. Also I do not plan on using R in the future so this part of the course was not very relevant to me, but it was not the hardest.",3
5041,"The course has fun illustrations and a high quality of production, but the lessons themselves don't dive very deep. Ideas are introduced but not considered in depth. One such example is variance. We get the equations but not much insight into what it is a measure of and it's value. Additionally, and this might just be me, but the experiments used to illustrate examples at times are difficult to understand.",3
5045,"Course material is not enough, you need to also refer at least one reference book as well.",3
5093,2 Stars less because they should have included R video tutorials,3
5117,"I have started this course again and again. Although the lectures themselves are clear enough, the quizzes are sometime so confusing and don't reflect the way that topic was taught. The worst part is R lab. I understand nothing of it. It makes no sense. I should not be part of a basic statistics course. I have wasted my money on a specialization that I can't get because I will not, and simply cannot learn R. They should have made that clear this would involve programming. I am only now thinking of learning from the videos but have given up the hope of getting a specialization certificate.The instructor in the first two session was still engaging, but starting in the third lesson the instructor is so boring and his voice makes me drowsy. Plus his sentences are so long and confusing. He has a horrible way to explain something. They need to keep in mind this is BASIC statistics, so cut down on the jargon. He does introduce the terms in 3.01 but just after one video the words don't magically sit in my memory.I've given 3 stars because although I have to work double hard just to make sense of what the instructor says by reading a book on basic statistics, at least the videos provide a structure, good examples and after watching them a few times things become clear.",3
5204,some of the videos were outstanding and easy to understand. Need more handholding for understanding of concepts and review/explanation of the quiz results will reinforce learning further.,3
5238,"The cartoons and animations used in this course really make statistics a lot easier and interesting. However few modules especially the later part of probability do not explain the concepts thoroughly. However, this is a great place to start!Also, the addition of R exercises are a great idea",3
5292,"I think the notes given after the lectures should contain the formula the students need. Also the quizes should show the correct answers once you completed them, if not you cant figure out why the questions are wrong.",3
5442,"Overall this course has some valuable information. Although, I found the pace was a bit fast, only covered enough to get by, not gradually building up to a point. Each assignment or lab you first have to struggle figuring out the skeleton code where they could have provided a bit more comments, tips and guidance. I would recommend this course for someone that at least have a basic Java or programming background. Not for complete new developers.",3
5444,"There are no lectures on Services, and Content Providers which are two key components of the Android system. It really disappointed me.",3
5452,"After 3 great courses in this specialization, this one was disappointing. The content just isn't explained well in the videos. The Labs were fine. I'm sorry but the course seemed rushed, and it isn't great marketing for the Bayesian approach. As a consequence, I am now not sure if I want to do the capstone......",3
5465,"Good course, but need more details.",3
5475,I found some of the instructional videos a bit confusing. It was difficult to understand the underlying methodology of some of the concepts explained. I believe the instructors assumed the students had a more rigorous understanding of the underlying calculus than was suggested for this course.,3
5524,"A bit boring, but still informative.",3
5544,"There is no discussion forum. There are some concepts made me confused and I want to discuss with some other classmates. Another thing is there almost has no example, teacher just say the principles. I think one or two example for a principle may make some concepts more clear and can be understood easier.",3
5598,"Thanks to this course, i am now understanding the principle and methodology of phylogenetics",3
5603,"This course is nice but very lengthy videos and at one points i didn't understand some topics , quiz are pretty tough to solve .",3
5645,The submission system for submitting assignments in most of the cases does not work.,3
5680,"It was a good Mooc, but I think it should imply many more examples to be made by the own students along the course. I really liked the previous one (Java for Android) and of course I´m going to finish the rest of courses. It´s worth it. On the other hand, examples are good and explanations properly presented. Good... but not as good as the previous.",3
5681,Not enough coding opportunities.,3
5683,"There is a lot of good information in the course about how different components communicate with each other in android; however, there is way too much information way too fast. I really enjoyed the rhythm in the first course but, this course left me lost more times than not. Its a great course if you plan on spending large amounts of time searching the web for other resources to complete the optional assignments",3
5691,"Overall it is OK, but the example framework is more like created for teach purpose which is not practical in industry. Moreover, it seems there are many incorrect part in the assignment especially optional code assignments.",3
5750,1 professor just did not make sense to me. do not just read out the pseudo code but instead try to visually show whats happening step by step with arrows and calculations from scratch,3
5765,Lectures are very confusing. Instructors should use white boarding to explain codes. Difficult to follow them.,3
5766,The materials covered are not enough to fully explore the topics. Should include much more detailed explanations especially when explaining some of the complex algorithms.,3
5781,This course covers important aspects of techniques used to solve popular problems. But it misses to cover introductory points in some modules (i.e: dynamic programming module) as well as the accent of some instructors isn't clear enough.,3
5794,"I really had a hard time understanding Dynamic Programming. I recoomend to remove this topic and focus more on solidifying foundations so that students can be more prepared for moving through the whole Algorithm Courses. I never heard of this topic before and the lecturer ommited many steps when explaining the Edit Distance. I was forced to look for other resources like Open Courseware Algorithms course, and this is how could understand what was dynamic programming easily. Hope this helps!",3
5801,"Homework was very nice, but strong accent of lecturers impeded me",3
5811,A little light on the theory,3
5827,"I had already done ""Algorithms: Design and Analysis Part 1"", so this course was not as good as that one.This course had lot of programming questions, which I find very good to have for any course. I just hope next courses of the specialization will be beneficial for my career.",3
5836,"Overall is good course with many exercises, forum is supportive, however mentors/instructors never answered my questions (i guessed they bothered only with the very first session when course was launched) Language is sometimes overly complicated and hard to grasp the main principles of the algorithm (e.g. dynamic programming week 5) I watched youtube to understand same ideas but explained in much simpler way.",3
5882,"The problem sets are great and probably worth the price, but the lectures become very hard to follow after week 3 and the discussion forums are very disorganized - it's hard to find useful information. Some of the lectures have slides available, some don't; some of the lectures have somewhat-useful subtitles/transcripts, others have incomprehensible garbled messes (I don't know if they're machine-generated or just transcribed by someone with no understanding of the material/vocabulary - logarithm != algorithm!).I really like the problem sets, but some of the lectures are pretty rough, just a guy talking in front of some pseudocode for 10 minutes. The instructors seem friendly and engaging, though.",3
5933,"I agree with some of the reviews here. It's fantastic at the beginning of the course. Towards the end, unfortunately the professor's accent is heavy and sometimes difficult to understand. The subtitles don't help either because they were auto-generated. My brain had to take extra cognitive workload to decipher what was actually said before trying to understand the materials on the slides and everything else. I also didn't like the way index 0 and 1 is mixed in different lectures. Why shouldn't we stay consistent in pseudocode using index starting with either 0 or 1? The slides are confusing regarding this matter especially when you translate algorithms into code.Nonetheless, I liked the assignments overall. The course's instructors included some of very interesting problems and indeed helped understand the lessons better. I also liked the course structure and the carefully prepared slides.",3
6004,"It was nice, considering the messages and the amount of time. However, participation and feedback by others was really limited.",3
6012,"descriptions was not enough for me, the BMC concepts could be more elaborated by giving examples and explaining different types of businesses.",3
6023,Still waiting for my assignment grades for weeks 1-3 despite having had many people mark these.,3
6025,"short, effective and precise, contain all necessary for a initial learner about Business Model Canvas. In my case, I am an intermediate learner, so it was not enough.",3
6026,If you are new in the learning of business model generation is a choice to start with. But if you already have some experiencie this course is very very basic.,3
6040,The course is pretty good for a beginner.But it emphasis too much on using third party authoring tools and proper coding is not implemented.The required code is auto-generated and we as learners are only asked to make few changes on the already existing code.,3
6047,good overview of ARAF,3
6054,"Well the course is reasonably well organized the material is in great detail exceeding what I would've thought the overview concept of big history would be. Other big history courses I've taken do not go into specific date and time detail, period by period But function more in terms of how preceding events may be causative for future events (more like a butterfly effect analysis over long periods of time).If you are looking for more detailed specific history than this course is useful. If you are looking for more of the big history overview concept this may not be the best course for you.",3
6123,"Excellent lecturers and high-quality material to study, although the course is heavily centered on human History as opposed to Big History - i.e. early Universe and its development over a time span of billions of years.",3
6170,"The history of the universe, mainkind and the future in 6 weeks. A very short introduction but a good idea",3
6196,"This course took me three months of several hours of work a week to complete. While I definitely learned a lot during that process, it would have been really helpful to have more active instructor engagement and feedback (although I realize that this may not be possible when an official course session is not in progress, which is when the bulk of my work for this course took place).I also think many of the problem statements could have been more clearly defined. For example, I spent a lot of time on the ""Bubble detection"" problem constructing graphs that allowed for multiple edges between two nodes, when it turned out that in order to pass I did not need to implement this.That being said, I've learned a lot from the courses in this specialization, and thanks for the work put into it!",3
6199,"The problems are interesting, the course is great. However, the problem sets in this programming challenge are often not so well-defined, which makes it really difficult to solve (especially the dataset problem). The solution of the problems usually turns out to be quite simple, but is not applicable to a large set of problems, only to the particular dataset that is given (and the characteristics of this dataset is not given; so I end up thinking about all possibilities that might occur for that dataset, which makes the problem more difficult).The examples given in the problem set are also not sufficient to describe the characteristics of the problem clearly.However, I really appreciate the whole courses, and I think it has been a great experience to go through the courses! Thank you very much!",3
6200,very difficult course if you are new to R. Otherwise an okay course,3
6202,The quizzes were engaging but i think it requires some knowledge in use R for data science. Though i learned a lot. Thanks again.,3
6211,There is not support in the forum,3
6223,The teacher explains concepts very well. Really worth the time to go over the lectures several times.The programming assignments however lack instructions and the online judgement system has some strange requests which are not illustrated in the instruction. You have to guess what the assignment is about each time.Overall very good lectures but poor assignments.,3
6228,So easy~But the teacher is well！,3
6254,"I missed information about behaviour in wild and domestic animals and also, some of the papers that you recomend are not for free, so some of us can't acces to that information.",3
6280,Good but can be long due to accompany material,3
6370,"Very interesting course, although lacks course notes. The final test (week 5) had a few questions which weren't covered in the lesson.",3
6393,good cource but its medical content about how to treat disease is low and needed to be moreand clinical cases is low alsobut another topics is very good,3
6442,"Course is mostly theoretical. So far it's difficult to say anything about its practical implications and usefulness. It's my first course on Coursera, so I can't compare. But I think sometimes it lacks a bit clarity, especially considering lecturer's English and bad quality of subtitles which sometimes do not match real lecturer's words. Anyway it was interesting and now I'm really intrigued about how I can apply this new knowledge to real everyday development tasks. Most probably I will try following courses in the specialization. Thanks a lot to authors!",3
6453,Thank you so much for the interesting course. My thesis in master was on Antibacterials and (and more subjects) I am much interested in Microbiology. I am going to continue my PhD in Microbiology and this course was a kind of review for me with some new details. Especially ResFinder was really interesting to me. Thank you so much for the class.,3
6480,"The course is really interesting and I found it really useful. However, there are lots of repetitive lectures and I think they could be grouped and summarized or even expanded for topics avoiding the repetitions.",3
6486,excellent for me and my carrier,3
6491,"I loved the first three weeks for the really well presented background information. Weeks 4 and 5 did not give me any further interesting knowledge. I also missed lectures on qPCR, NGS and other molecular methods for the detection of antibiotic resistance genes, as these methods are up and coming. Overall, thank you for setting up this course",3
6498,"lectures are too long, it lacks clinical correlation.the course focus only technical lab issues, when you look for antimicrobial resistance course, the last thing that you need is tech theory. Of course that some concepts are needed in order to provide fundamental basis, but the main goal is and always will be how to interpret antibiograms and infere the most probable mechanism of resistance. So there is a need for clinical correlation. If its not present, the course should be entitled ""Laboratory methods for antimicrobial resistance""",3
6514,"It was much more complete, diverse and time-consuming than expected. The quality of the teachings was inequal in my humble opinion. I found Pr.Germano a bit stiff in his teaching and it was very hard for me to follow his classes. Other teachers were great though.",3
6523,"The course is supposed to be very informative. It is in fact. But after I spend hours raising my intellectual level trying to understand what they're talking about, I still have no idea what is the purpose of the meditation.Or rather I have it, but from another source, from a person who's been practicing it for 20 years. In 10 minutes I was given a crystal clear and logical answer on what is was all about. Unfortunately this course doesn't give this answer. It will rather improve your skill of understanding highly intellectual texts and will show you some interesting stuff about the brain.",3
6525,Good overview of buddhist meditation,3
6544,Learned a lot and already integrated daily meditation into my life.,3
6548,"I have to admit that the professors know the topic and are conducting amazing research, but the course was dry and terribly designed. The videos are too long, without quizzes or activities to break the long dry monologues. They also talk like robots and one gets lost really fast. I have taken many courses in coursera with long and short videos, with boring and engaging teachers but this is by far the worse. They are trying to show off so much information and in such a high level language (to most), that it makes it incredibly boring. I should add that I have studied Buddhism, and there are so many better ways to provide people an opportunity to come into contact with this beautiful topic.",3
6565,"The faculty of this course represent a wonderful assembly of knowledge and experience. But the course was not well organized, and the emphasis on fine teaching that I have found in most Coursera courses was not present.",3
6566,I didn't like the main lecturer of the course. I believe his is smart and everything but for me as non-native english speaker I found the way he speaks is extremely hard for comprehension.,3
6567,empty of value,3
6569,Interesting,3
6583,"Great theme for a course, perfect idea, but I had some issues with execution of it. So, these are the issues:",3
6589,Very informative but not very focused or streamline. The lectures on brain plasticity and such I found largely irrelevant to the subject matter. Maybe an attempt to make the lectures a little less 'wordy'. I know this is Buddhism which is notoriously filled with concepts and long winded explanations but I think a lot of viewers could lose interest. I enjoy the course but I already have a great deal of familiarity with Buddhism. I was a Vajrayana practitioner for three years. Maybe a course focused more on Shakyamuni and the basics of Buddhist teaching along with a few courses familiarizing listeners to terms might be useful as a preliminary to the following courses.,3
6594,Some lectures are presented in very flat boring to follow manner. Though neuroscience part is presented brilliantly and makes it totally worth.,3
6604,"The positive.What a wealth of material! This is a very worthy attempt to integrate the history, philosophical underpinnings and modern transformations of Tibetan Buddhist meditation.Clifford Saron’s Week 2 lectures on neuroscience and neuroplasticity were fascinating and intriguing introductions to the topic - very engaging.The negative.Too academic for an introductory course. David Germano’s lectures are full of information but he doesn’t help the learner to make sense of it. His ‘academic speak’ obfuscates meaning rather than making it accessible. More diagrammatic slides at the start would give learners a framework of the overarching concepts.Because of the many perspectives presented each week, this course needs A LOT of time. I personally would have leaned better if the course were broken into smaller weekly segments.",3
6607,"(I posted this review in a blog [https://guhyasamajacenter.wordpress.com/2015/10/03/review-of-the-free-coursera-tibetan-buddhist-meditation-and-the-modern-world-lesser-vehicle-course-given-by-uva/]. Much of the courseware was outstanding. Many of the videos were so poorly done (boring) that I couldn't watch them. (I do not watch people read prepared text in a video. Ever.)----------- From the blog ----------------------------------I recently took the FREE Coursera course, ""Tibetan Buddhist Meditation and the Modern World"". (https://www.coursera.org/learn/buddhist-meditation) From the course catalog: "" Tibetan Buddhist Meditation and the Modern World explores the immense variety of meditation practices past and present. We present their histories, their philosophical underpinnings, their transformations in the modern global world, and we give you a chance to reflect upon meditation practices through secular contemplations designed just for this course."" (Note: In the class overview, it is noted that the term ""Lesser Vehicle"" is ""perjorative"" but they use it anyway. ??"")There are many FREE reasons to take this FREE ""Lesser Vehicle"" course (the first of four):#1 - An awesome, wonderful hour-long interview with Sharon Salzberg, one of the founders of the Insight Meditation Society. What an awesome lady. I was not aware that she is also a Dzogchen student. (Did I mention it was FREE?) Worth signing up for the course just to skip to Week 6 to watch this interview.#2 - Guided Meditations by Dr. Anne Klein and Anam Thubten. Very, very, very nice. FREE, it's ALL FREE.#3 - The Science of Mindfulness against the Background of the Scientific Study of Meditation videos with Dr. Clifford Saron, neuroscientist. His videos start in Week 1 and continue through Week 6 in building a basis for understanding the scientific research on meditation. He (and the course) demonstrates what can and cannot (presently) be scientifically proven about meditation. One excellent example: Two trained pianists were told to learn a complicated piece of music, one with the piano, and the other only in his imagination. After 2 weeks (I think) of practice, their brains' MRI patterns exhibited almost the exact same changes. Dr. Saron noted that the results are not definitive but still may have implications for the compassion/bodhicitta meditations we do.#4: An interview on ""Buddhist Modernism"", with David McMahan. Very much academic-oriented. One statement, in particular, struck me since, the more I think about it, the more I think it might be true: ""The Buddhist Tantra teachings are not accepted nor are they popular in the West."" For all the Buddhist monastics that visit the USA and the West to grab donations and go back to their home countries, few of them are sticking around to teach complete Tantra classes. The few that do (and do it well) are having a hard time making ends meet. (That's just my opinion, I guess.)There are also short 5-10 minute interviews with Khenpo Tsultrim Lodro (a short ""snapshot"" of the Tibetan take on the week's particular subject, which was often better (to me) than the 90min-long ""talking head"" version ) and Ven. Tsoknyi Rinpoche (""How does Buddhism change in a New Culture"" and ""Benefits and Dangers of Secularing Buddhism"", the TB rebuttal, as it were. He did note that motivation is the key. Bad agenda = bad results, good motivation will cause good results.)Have I noted the course is FREE? So you can take the course, and the following courses, without doing any of the assignments/quizzes. Watch (or download) any video or transcript to your heart's content whenever you wish in any order you wish. (That assumes the courses are not taken off-line at a future date.) Further in the course description is a blurb that may point to at least 3 future courses in ""Mahāyāna, …Vajrayāna, …and a fourth vehicle, which is explicit in many Tibetan materials, though no standard term ever emerged that was accepted by all sectarian traditions - we will thus term it as the “Natural Vehicle” or “Post Tantra”."" If the quality of guided meditations (GM) in following classes are even half the quality of this course's GM's, then that's all the reason I need to continue the future classes, too.Course gotchas:#1. That said (other shoe dropping here), the other half of the course was videos of people reading their prepared academic papers, in monotone or semi-monotone voices. (Transcripts are available. I figure I can read a paper in 5% of the time someone else reads it to me in a video. Ugh.) However, they would probably need the voice of Morgan Freeman, James Earl Jones, B. Cumberbatch or James Spader to keep me awake. To be fair, the content is golden, although the papers seems to be geared to the academic community, rather than the student community. Books and Videos on these subjects are all over Amazon, YouTube, FPMT, Dharma-Documentaries, etc.#2. The Sharon Salzberg (SS), in her interview, brought up an excellent point. She noted that she and a noted clinical psychology (CP) scientist (researcher) (whose name I have forgotten) were at a conference where the issue on the table was that someone was having trouble with ""loving kindness"" meditation as a first meditation class. SS noted that she would instantly recommend the student change to ""calm abiding"" meditation whereas the CP could not change that student's meditation technique to another technique (such as calm abiding) as her research findings would then be invalid. Similarly, many of the non-Buddhist guided meditations that I viewed in this course felt like a physical education or ""How To"" class. Do this. Do that. It did not feel as though they lived the material, just taught it. (Whereas it was patently obvious Dr. Klein & Anam Thubten were definitely ""walking the walk"", so to speak, so were able to speak from the heart.)Interviews I did not watch, that may be of great interest to others, include meditation in the school system by Tish Jennings, meditation in the Business Community (an interview with David Mick), the Burmese meditation tradition in an interview with Erik Braun, the MBSR (Meditation Based Stress Reduction) with Susan Bauer-Wu, and meditation in the legal community with Rhonda Magee.And all that is just the first course. Many of it's ""failings"" may just be my karmic opinions. The course is worth checking out and watching/reading/meditating on those parts that interest you. In that respect, the breadth of the course content is quite nice and so well done. Grade: B-.",3
6617,An interesting class that traces the origins of Buddhist meditation and the Western usage today. A nice dovetailing of research topics covered to attempt to link measurable changes due to meditation practices while trying to maintain a good control group; not easy.,3
6626,"I could barely get the videos to work. The information was great, what I could get to, anyways.",3
6787,The course is good. I just do not give five stars because we have to pay to atempt pass.,3
6828,"Very interesting course for those who want to fully understand the inner workings of a computer.However, the utilities offered are a bit neglected. Be prepared to fight bugs on your own.",3
6879,Very interesting but too many informations on a short course,3
6937,its a very basic course helps you a lot if . you don't have much background in the feild,3
6961,Its very informative but not attractive.,3
6963,"The contents of this course will be familiar to anyone who reads popular science books. The course is useful mainly for pulling various strands together, but don't expect much depth.",3
7075,Helps me a lot understand how to organize knowledge and study better. Thank you very much!,3
7161,I'm kind of disappointed with this last level. It isn't really what i expected.,3
7165,"Expecting more hands on experience with big data frameworks like Hadoop or Spark. Instructions of the final assignment is very confusing, you don't actually know what it really want you to do until you go through all the Q&As in the discussion forum, which is really wasting time.",3
7168,"Good information overall, but the ""peer graded"" assignment at the end is poorly designed and seems unnecessarily arbitrary. Not a clear value add over a ""final exam"" format to justify waiting days for someone to ""grade"" your work. Instructions for this assignment are poorly written and unclear - for example, completely NOT clear you are asking us to identify a primary key versus stating there is no primary key, etc.",3
7180,IMHO it's better to reduce the scope but provide more details of key technologies. Final assignment is not well explained.,3
7187,1. The course is very general and high level introduction.2. During the lectures there are some examples that in some cases are presented as very small images and briefly. I personally could not understand some examples presented in week 5.3. I found the hands-on lectures very helpful. I wish there was more that would delve into more examples in more details.4. The course was very overpriced given the amount of information offered compared to other courses I have taken at coursera.Thanks.,3
7190,Not Very relevant and detailed as the previous course. The content is not as clear and simple as previous course,3
7191,The final test has little to do with the course. You must do extra study to respond.,3
7199,"There has been very few on-hands training. It's still very very at an introductory level. At some points it goes very deep, for example with the vectors for a document, but with the rest stay at a very high level. Open an excel sheet can not be considered training ...",3
7200,"This course offers very useful high level overview of concepts and ideas which make you feel confident in the long run. However, the course is extremely basic and does not go deep beyond the high level concepts. The hands on exercises are boring and do not engage students. The course needs to be improved to make it more useful for students. This course is not very worthy of the money.",3
7202,"The course takes a broad approach to the subject.What I miss: the study material should provide more and better organized (theoretical) information (e.g. on topcis like database design, data structures, etc.)What I like: presenting of current software projects around big data",3
7212,"I really wish I could give this course more stars, the content is great and well delivered and at a perfect level for someone like me who last worked with big data sets when 20Mb was absolutely enormous and Windows 3.1 was cutting edge technology. But and this seems to run across the whole specialisation, support from the course team varies between very patchy and none at all. Technical questions aren't answered for days if at all.",3
7216,The level of the exercises and quizzes don't reflect the content of the course.,3
7218,"Reasonably good, but less structured and organized that the first course.I hope the next one will be better on this aspect.",3
7221,"The content of the course is very good, but the definitions and explanations are not straight forward.",3
7226,Just about okay. Wouldn't recommend to pay for this.,3
7228,This was my second course of six. It was so theoretical but at the final exam it required so much exercises. I propose enrich the course with exercises and hands on,3
7234,"Peer-graded assignments are bad for multiple reasons. Most important one -- If I'm paying for this course I expect my work will be verified by skilled people, not by other ""students"".",3
7237,"Although Content quality was good, the content is too much less and could have been easily integrated to first course or other course in specialisation.Secondly Quiz were not challenging ,it was just too easy to pass, and this actually takes away the very reason they were employed in this course.",3
7242,More practical exercises should be recommended.,3
7243,"A good course taking into account that it does not require previous knowledge. I am giving ""only"" 3 stars because for a basic (no previous requirements) course I would expect much more additional readings. On the other hand, if you have programming or database experience you will find some topics too ""basic"".I have liked it more than the first course on the specialization but I would expect more details (I think general topics are well explained).",3
7244,"3.5+ star course. I hope by studying the following courses, contents of this course prove to be more practical.",3
7247,1*(star) to the professor very difficult to understand the professor many times. Even the subtitles fail sometimes to present what he says. 5*(star) to the content of the course and especially the tool used to explain and learn the BI concepts. I have already recommended the tool to couple of companies.,3
7264,Difficult to understand the video lectures at time but really useful content. Excellent further reading sections at the end of each module.,3
7272,"this course is great in concept. but the reality was disappointing and will have to improve. the professor gave lots of links to interesting external materials. but his prepared lectures were much briefer and consisted mostly of presenting bullet-point lists. as a result, i found myself studying just to pass the quizes and not to actually enhance my knowledge. :( given the high standard of the other courses in this specialization, i'm sure it will be better next time....",3
7276,"Content of the course is very good, useful and interesting, I greatly appreciate the knowledge delivered. But assignments could improve:-All module assignments seems mostly focalize on using Microstrategy tool. In assignments, i would like to see more exercises so that students learn through practice of business cases. For example, I prefer the way modules are organized in courses 1,2, and 3: concepts with examples, practice exercise, then assignment through similar exercise + a quiz.-In last assignment, there was no suggested solution(s) for the last question, i think this is missing for a good understanding.",3
7277,I did the free part of the course. It was too simpleI did other free MOOCs that had much more.The videos were like reading a book. The subject is interesting and there's some potential to the practical part of the course.I only did the first 3 weeks,3
7317,"Accurate , but very basic information.",3
7345,"Loved the course, would take a continuation if available. Little basic but with enough info. Great ideas for cooking. Felt it was too based in USA information and some was not really conclusive.",3
7406,"There are some nice cooking tips, but this is targeted to very young students/parents with no cooking experience, and I expected more than general information on food impacts on children.",3
7420,"learned something, but not as much as i expected. hope to add more nutrition knowledge.",3
7455,"After taking a Nordic food diet course where they talked about children's' diets in the Nordic countries and how they were changing the norm, this course covered the basics as to what and why certain foods are good for you.

7587,The course seems like it would benefit parents but does not do much for a nutrition health professional.,3
7608,"Very good place to start for beginners with some scientific information. Easy and quick to do food demonstrations, basic enough that students can build upon them depending on what is available at hand.Some ideas just tend to be redundant throughout the weeks, but I guess that is what she wants to stress on. No to processed food!! :)) I just wish you kept the discussion boards open, so we have a platform to discuss ideas and exchange recipes.",3
7651,Simplistic. But so easy for anyone to watch and learn. I wish more people would take this course.,3
7690,"Good information, a bit basic though. I would've enjoyed a more in depth course.",3
7745,"It is a really interesting course, it refers to the general public, with smart tips and quick recipies. Also, for those who know nothing about the sience part of lipids, carbohydrates and trace elements, in generall, it constitutes a very informative ''package'' for everyone. There is no specialaization in this kind of coures us I expected, because I am a food technologist, I kwnow most of the parts, but still it is really helpfull and interestin! Verry good job!",3
7764,"Good course for beginners, but those with higher levels of nutrition knowledge will likely: 1. Find it way too easy; 2. Find that the recipes actually contain rather unhealthy ingredients (e.g., always avoid butter--too unhealthy); and 3.

7796,Child Nutrition and Cooking was a pretty fun and easy course. As a stay at home mom and experience novice cook since childhood this class was more of a recap of basic cooking for me and a nice reminder of nutritional goals and current standards. I enjoyed it for my introduction to Coursera. Unfortunately this course didn't offer offer a certificate or statement of accomplishment in any form at the time I took it. :(,3
7813,"Very basic course, not too challenging to a non-american.",3
7868,"This is a great course for new parents who have no background on child nutrition. For those who are already familiar with basic nutrition, most of this course may be a review for you but there's some good information and facts to take away. I wish the instructor had a little more training/skill in the cooking segments (e.g. basic knife skills she said don't cut your finger but held the knife completely wrong, using the knife to point at different ingredients).",3
8001,"The modules are rampant with bias against ""big food,"" without considering the science. On the other hand, if you take the course as a whole, then yes, the population would be better off if we all followed the suggestions contained in this course than if we continue on our current path for how we consume food. So the general idea is not without merit. However, I would have expected better from a Stanford faculty member. What is being taught should be just the science, without opinions or biases.",3
8030,Good and clear content. A bit from an American point of view... I missed some in depth explanation (like the class of the nerv-system or the Glycemic index). Overall easy to watch and good lessons.,3
8094,"this course is very useful if you want to learn about something that majority of people(not including me) don't care about, and is based on out-dated info and opinions of a high middle class, house mom. this course is a waste of data. someone get some actual statistics here.",3
8141,"I really enjoy the food preparation and the important facts about our body, about our food intake habits. thank u a lot Maya.",3
8149,good course,3
8151,"Good overall course, basic and got me interested in cooking again!",3
8162,"Nice course about eating suggestions and good recipesIt could be useful giving details on how making a diet for children, with information about calories they need and so on",3
8172,It was very challenging. It would be better if a couple of practice exercises were put after the relevant lecture videos and not just after the weekly lecture videos.,3
8195,discussion thread should be answerable and solution to the test should be available...all other things are good.,3
8278,Good course if you do not have any idea about Big Data and the technology used.,3
8286,"Was expecting more hands on stuffs, the class is too conceptual. The sound volume of the videos is not consistent, hope Coursera can improve a bit on this.",3
8288,No technical support is provided for VM issues.,3
8307,Quite shallow...,3
8311,"An amazing course to get a brief understading about Big Data, the course needs an improvement in the slides, and additional resources for better understading.",3
8336,"The first week or so feels inconsistent and oversimplified. After that, when you get into the actual content, it gets much better. It then ends on a peer-graded assignment. While the assignment itself is creative and fun to complete, I've never been a fan of peer-graded assignments so early in an introductory course load.",3
8342,this course need some odifications because of cloudera version,3
8347,I'm not sure who the target audience is for this course. The level of presentation seems rudimentary to me. I had a hard time sustaining interest in the course and did not finish.,3
8349,"I little slow to start but the pace picks up nicely. Content is generally easy to follow. Some differences between spoken and voice recognition subtitled text. Practical tests were interesting but not particularly well explained for the MapReduce shapes task, which seemed to leave a few puzzled.",3
8353,It would be good if more explanation and more examples are demonstrated.,3
8360,The classes could have been delivered by creating more interest.,3
8367,Basic info covered.,3
8369,The time / usefulness rate of this course is very low. Most of the stuff they teach (at least in introduction) is very basic theory that's presented in not really interesting way.,3
8389,it's too much basic stuffs.,3
8391,There should be some reading material to assist learning. The course was too expensive for the small content it provided,3
8392,"The course was very useful with what knowledge it provides. However, it would be better if there were more hands-on exercises on relevant stuff. The exercises are too easy and boring. Tougher exercises should be added and more time should be spent on the Hadoop Ecosystem part. Knowing the history helps but it should not replace more important topics.",3
8396,The course is a lot about talking and theory which is not very interesting. Final part of course is trying to work with hadoop using virtualbox and provided virtual image.,3
8408,too philosophical,3
8416,"A good introduction to big data (last time I was working with it was in the 1990s when a few 10s of MB was a huge dataset!). Slightly let down by the forums, despite loads of mentors there seems to be almost no presence of the teaching staff beyond setting up a few posts to spark discussion which in reality just prompt short responses and no replies.",3
8421,Good introduction to big data. I would prefer that the hadoop lesson have more practical exercices;,3
8456,"A little bit too conceptual and very basic. Hadoop hands on and HDFS should be much more intensive. However, good material, well presented and explained.",3
8469,"It's a good introduction, but more optional hadoop exercises can be added.",3
8470,"I'd recommend this course be taken as audit. Doesn't add specific value to your skill set! But, it's good to know :-)",3
8471,An introductory course that seems like it should have been the first week of a more in-depth course instead of being a stand-alone course. The cost vs benefit of this particular course is questionable.,3
8478,"The content of the course is alright and up to date. The instructors are also good, passionate and has a great knowledge.What brings everything down is the video editing and the slide design/quality. They are terrible and clearly not in the field of profession of the creators.All in all, it is an average course, but I can recommend it to anyone interesting in the topic, because it does its job. If someone could improve the slides and the video editing could reach the youtube video reviewer/critic level, it could easily do a 4 out of 5.",3
8484,"I believe this course can be performed much faster, beware that it is really an introduction, and IT professionals persons may feel it slow, in addition the presenter speaks English very slowly, good for non English proficient persons, but bad for the others.",3
8492,The course is ok but I found that there were some technical quirks that could be ironed out first. Example is to download the text files in the final assignment the command wget is invaluable. How to leave safe mode if the Name node is in safe mode. VirtualBox is default to 32 bit/ubuntu when the image is 64 bit/Centos/Redhat.In addition the course content is a bit little. It says 3 weeks but I finish it in 2 days. Perhaps it is about quality and not quantity.,3
8510,Introductory Level Course.Nothing much on analytical methods.,3
8512,Very informative but the structure is a lecture where the concepts are basically read from a paragraph. Perhaps I'd give more stars if I only saw diagrams.,3
8535,"Only skims the surface of Big Data, even for an introduction course.",3
8542,"This is an introduction course, and no advanced concepts are seen. I think it provides a good background, that is all. If you have a solid technical (programming, databases, etc.) knowledge maybe you will miss more hand-ons. For me, for an introductory and theoretical course I expected more resources, for example additional suggested readings, optional exercises...Lectures are well structured (intro and summary at the end), but I have missed presentations from some of the most interesting videos (week 6).",3
8650,Very good introduction. light-weight explanations.Better animations and videos could enhanced the learning process.questions are too easy.Needs more complex tasks to integrates the different sections together.,3
8669,I would prefer to see the speaker during the lecture.,3
8676,I found this course useful and appropriate in the material offered and the assessed questions as an introduction and an update in cancer biology for CPD purposes. It is rather disappointing that the final grade achieved is not printed on the certificate. For A$65 to join the course and not have the full information such as the hours involved and the final grade achieved makes it very disappointing not to reflect the effort I put in as well as tricky to include this course as part of a CPD program.,3
8683,I wish that the classifications of the major cancer groups were more descriptive. concerning the treatment for different types of lung cancer for example. Nothing is mentioned about childhood cancers or the area of lymphomas. I realize that this is an overview of cancer but cancer cell biology and current treatment practices based on immunologic findings were not given the coverage they deserve.,3
8685,"Tough call on this. The course itself is excellent [5] but the ""money grab, you must pay attitude"" is horrible [0].",3
8694,"I think that the course itself is very interesting and useful, but unfortunately you have to purchase the course straight away to be able to do the tests.",3
8704,Better than previous but still not good quility,3
8705,A bit too theoritical,3
8707,"Although very interesting, this course seemed too short for me.Professor Kofman is an expert in the filed, but he mostly reads thewords on the slides and shows little or no passion or interest in sharing hisideas and work whatsoever.",3
8709,"Just good to catch the basics. Sometimes quite boring to follow the professor, but it covers the basics adequately.",3
8734,Too much information loaded.,3
8736,"If you are a finace or business student this is not for you, its a complete re-run of most of the basics that re taught with some practical real life examples. Good for a person who is new to the subject of business or finance.",3
8753,It wasn't Exactly what I'd expected but was still a good course.,3
8790,"Could have more in depth content, a bit shallow sometimes.",3
8803,"Didn't really elevate my writing. Mostly due to the fact that there were no practical exercises included. Though some of the theoretical stuff that is covered is sort of common sense, most is still very relevant, so I don't regret taking the course.",3
8804,Felt that it could have more writing exercises.,3
8806,"Good. Overall it is basic, speaker could talk faster and in general the course could move a lot faster. Room for improvement.",3
8807,"Some irritating errors, but overall it was okay.",3
8817,Too high level,3
8826,It's useful to anyone who wants to improve writing skills.,3
8841,"Testing choice isn't great. Writing a letter, outline, etc. and submitting it for peer review would have been more productive. Furthermore, some questions in Week 2 test are confusing, the original meaning the test designer is trying to convey is, which dictates what the right answer is, isn't clear, giving too much room to interpretation not allowing the answer to be empirically right.",3
8843,"The course was very short and very basic. I do not think it is fair to call it ""High-Impact Business Writing"" when all you get is an introduction to business writing. It would be nice to have a more extensive course on this subject. I would retake it if it was improved. My rating reflects the lack of high-quality content with more examples.",3
8871,"The modules had a lot of aspects and covered each one in detail. However, it would have been helpful to have some hands-on exercises like writing an executive summary, evaluating a resume, writing an elevator pitch etc so that people learn from each other. Otherwise, its a great course with emphasis on different aspects of business writing. Thanks",3
8881,Very helpful tips for preparing a professional business document. Hoping the course could have more focused exercises to make sure learners actually master the skills.,3
9015,I wish it had more interaction with the teachers or to at least have more level of detail on the cases. I am afraid tha as a final project it was not of a very high use for me.,3
9027,"The course as a whole is excellent (5 stars), however, the Capstone project part of the specialization consists of 3 submissions that are reviewed by other students. Consequently the quality of the reviewers are of the same level as the student itself - which obviously limits the learnings from feedback.",3
9048,"The many errors in the quizzes and the basic structure of the course - like having no link to a textbook in a central location - makes the experience of the course very very poor. The quality of the material makes up for it, to some extent - but there needs to be more Coursera support (I think) to get the errors in quizzes and stuff sorted out. The mods are doing an amazing job keeping people calm, but Coursera needs to do better.",3
9123,This one got away from me. I think I need Calculus for Dummys!,3
9166,Lecture videos are good. Assessment of knowledge (quizzes) are weak.,3
9181,"The teacher is very passionate; therefore I enjoyed the topics that were taught very differently than when I took AP Calculus AB in high school. The answer input sections for the tests and quizzes were rather frustrating because I had to type very specific keys on the keyboard just to input a constant or a polynomial. And one typo caused me to fail some assignments. Also the decimal approximations were very specific to the point where if I didn't type an extra number in the tenths, hundredths, or thousandths place then I would get the answer wrong even if I did the problem correctly.",3
9279,Need to take a hiatus; this would be the perfect class to prep for my TexEs teacher certification test in two years.,3
9281,Great teaching methodology - although the test are a bit too centered on number crunching and not reasoning. (a lot of number crunching and no room for little numerical mistake although reasoning is good),3
9302,"The course is best suited for an Intermediate student. Course is good to have since oit convers the topic from its very basic perspective. For graduates this course is more time consuming and dosnt recommended.Advantages:-very simple descriptions-even a non mathematical background student can easily understand-Proofs in all forms(geometric, analatic, practical) descrition.Disav:-basic are explained and consuming too much time-dosnt going for advanced level-no high level explanations or topics.",3
9382,"The professor spends LOTS of time doing really, really simple work -- over-explaining things, to be honest, in such a way that makes them more confusing. Then he does not explain much more complex issues throughout the course. Very frustrating, even as someone who has taken calculus before and is just taking this as a ""refresher.""",3
9496,I'm missing mathematical proofs.,3
9573,"This is actually good. the tutor is very fun and it makes me feel clearly about calculus. But, it will be more excellent if this course give a short quiz for each topic in end of the section. And for the final test, can this course give more test? I mean like more question in number or kind of test.",3
9577,The lecturer was really great and was able to explain things enthusiastically and simply. Unfortunately I feel the level of the course is too low. I think the basis of calculus has to come from rigorous definitions of the concepts involved and firm understanding of the proofs. Hopefully I will get some of that in your Calculus Two course.,3
9578,There were and still are some typos in tests.,3
9579,got the job done,3
9596,"Some of the contents just seem overly complex, especially the videos. If they would do a few problems similar to those in the quizzes, it would be much more better.",3
9625,"It is a good course, but the quiz/exercises are very difficult, and sometimes, unrelated to the topics",3
9645,"There is some good material in this course. The text is fairly good. But I have two main reservations about the course. The first is that the lectures do not always correspond closely enough with the quizzes, and with the text. There are times when one can take a quiz and think, ""How exactly does this relate to the lectures I just saw?"" The text has quite a few exercises, but there is a tendency to throw in one or two problems whose difficulty is an order of magnitude above everything else in that section, and I find this discouraging and a waste of time. Save those for a later course, or put them into a separate ""Extra Challenges"" section. Learning calculus is hard enough without trying to grapple without some really tricky trig problem at the same time. as a single example.The second reservation is with the instructor's manner. Many students find it very enjoyable. I am not one of them. Much of the time, he's OK, especially when the camera is not pointed at him. But as the course progresses, much of the footage is of him at his desk, and the closeups become more and more extreme, the hand-waving and fist-clenching approach sheer windmilling, and the exaggerated eye-rolling, grinning and so forth become so distracting that I can't bear to watch. I realize that the goal was to avoid being a dry-as-dust droning professor, and that is commendable, but there is a happy middle ground between that and hamming. I can almost speculate that there was an impulse to add in cartoon sproing-bonk-cuckoo-klaxon sound effects. (There is actually one such sound effect, but just one, so I won't quibble on that.)I would have found the class more effective with a demeanor that was enthusiastic without being histrionic. I'm sure this is one of those ""you either love it or hate it"" things, and I may be in the minority.The instructor is not generally one to throw out some concept that has not already been learned and then just motor on without explanation. He errs on the side of overly-detailed explanation, which to me is preferable to skipping over subjects or techniques and assuming you know them.Having said all of this, I repeat that there is good material, and you can learn the fundamentals of calculus for free in this course.",3
9702,"too easy,not fit me",3
9772,"My least favorite course in the specialization. The lectures are harder to follow, and are actually all about bioinformatics algorithms, which wasn't clear from the course description. Thankfully, as with the graphs course, Michael Levin wades in to save the day for the last couple of weeks. His lectures are really well structured, intuitive and clear.",3
9774,I think last week was too complex and not that exciting.,3
9775,"Good contents, but lectures could be improved for clarity.",3
9788,Very difficult test programs,3
9790,"The lecture was very abstract and difficult. I could pass the course somehow by writing the code presented in the lecture, but I must say I understand less than the half of the course contents.###Responding to question from the instructor, I clarify the comments above.I found the whole lecture difficult. This may be because the subject is not something I have even thought about. It was difficult to understand the difference and importance of key concepts such as trie, suffix, class, etc. Overall, I learned that the tricks somehow work, but my comprehension was not as deep as I can think about the extension or applications. I guess more examples or providing intuition would help me to digest the material.",3
9807,"you have to let us know in the beginning of the course, that we have to pay for finish the course!!!",3
9816,"I didn't really feel that there was enough material here to make a six-week course, so that there was a great deal of repetition, and very little context of the Roman period.",3
9818,Historically the basic background have been discussed. Effort was to make it nationalistic and emotional.Significance of Menorah as a symbol is absolutely missing. All the emphasis was on the Arch but the Arch looses its very significance without the menorah. So this should be covered or shared properly. For example Questions like why 7 hands needs to be replied. Why 3 legs needs to be repliedWhy painting ? This learning was not supposed to be in it. Someone might or might not like painting as a concept to learn and the course title also gave no indication towards that.. Wrong to make it a mandatory part as an assignment.,3
9840,Videos are too short,3
9874,i need android programming based course specially in xamrin / visual studio ........... i feel so much disappointment .,3
9905,There are courses that offer better level of details and better course materials and presentation .. and also for free ..However this course is a best-effort course and is helpful for beginners.,3
9906,"Good overall but you should use better microphone, because sometimes it's hard to understand and improve your English.",3
9925,This could be improved by adding more interesting subjects :- how to use list adapters with list view- how to use menus- how to use scrolling view- etc,3
9941,Very interesting but i don't like switching e-learning platforms,3
9958,"Pros: a lot of programming in automated online environment.Cons: inconsistencies in code like changing parameter order in often used functions, changing structure of some variables (arrays become dicts). This can be unneccesarily misleading.",3
9977,"This is not a beginner's course unless you already have previous programming experience. The Python lessons are just samples taken from a completely different curriculum on Codecademy and poorly integrated into the bio-centric course content. The lessons are disjointed, taken out of context, and some of the examples are using the wrong version of Python and missing parentheses. It would be a lot better if they took the time to actually craft custom Python lessons designed specifically for this course instead of using ill-fitting lessons from other classes.",3
9987,This course is the worst i have taken on coursera. They just want to mention everything in very short time. Quiz is much harder than material on video.,3
10007,"Not for beginners in the slightest. Enjoyed the videos. But the quiz just made me feel stupid as I didn't have a clue on any of the equations and simulators I was supposed to use. It got me thinking of how ignorant clever people continue to be! Every time a smart person comes up with a new theory it's taken as fact. Give it a couple of decades and someone will prove it wrong. The sun orbiting us proving wrong, easth is flat, gas giants only orbit outside the habitable zone etc etc etc. So when will we learn that just because something happens on this planet doesn't mean it will, has happened elsewhere. The deepest depths of the ocean have life forms, yet we'd perish. So who's to say life forms can't exact on a planet, moon that is nothing like the earth! The world is still at the centre of the universe to these academics!",3
10010,"This is a very good and informational course : however, the person who is speaking tends to have a lot of mums and stammers a lot. Overall, pretty decent course.",3
10032,Good but not deep enough. It could be longer to cover more aspects or more profound.,3
10037,A very informative course that will definitely help you to excel in your professional field.,3
10040,Teresa is great! she seems very friendly and kind but some contents are a little bit borried and difficult.,3
10043,More case studies perhaps?,3
10044,"The accent of this teacher made me struggle to comprehend some of the most basic concepts she was presenting. I learned way much more on the previous modules of this specialization.The course should be 2/5 stars, but thanks to Boston and McKenzie articles, I will give an extra one.",3
10046,"A good course, but not up to par with the first two. The content was far more theoretical and left me looking for applicable information. That said it was still a good course.",3
10049,good but sometimes cannot hear clearly what the tutor says whenever they have strong Spanish accent.,3
10050,"I liked the professor very much, and the expert interviews were interesting. On the other side, she used a lot of articles from the internet which gave not much knowledge. I think it would be better to use more material from professional manuals, not from ""trendy"" websites.",3
10059,"The video lectures are informative and interesting, but the QUIZZES COVER INFORMATION NOT ADDRESSED IN THE LECTURES!!",3
10061,"Interesting subject matter, but offered in an insufficient way. Bad transcripts, for example: AND THE POTENTIAL IMPACT COULD BE SERIOUS FOR LOCAL POPULATIONS AND THE GLOBAL COMMUNIST, THAT MEANS YOU – am I a global communist? And quizzes with questions that cannot be answered from the course texts. There are far better courses on this subject, from the University of Alberta (Coursera) or the University of British Columbia (edX).",3
10081,Lower quality when compared to the previous courses in this specialization. Neo4j is very interesting but it is poorly explained.,3
10087,All the complexity of the course is concentrated to the last week.,3
10088,"I would have liked to put 5 stars. This topic is so important and relevant to big data. After week 4 hands on part, it became obvious we will not see how to implement or interpret the more abstract graph concepts presented in week 3. That was very disappointing.Moreover, the structure of the course is not as good as the other module. I don't understand the lack of balance between theory and hands on (Not enough hands on to reflect the theory) part.On a constructive note, I would replace some of the theoretical concepts of week 3 with additional information on how to link a graph database to machine learning OR I would add more hands on exercise to help using those more complex concepts and learn how to interpret them.",3
10089,"I like the content at a high level, and I have a better appreciation for the value of graph analytics. That being said, I struggled with the GraphX hands on exersizes, where many of the Scala commands simply hung.",3
10094,"Really Thank you for all the big data course, just a little about the 5th course, Graph analytic, I think can must go to the deeper insight with more explanation, some of the modules was really vague!Thank you",3
10096,"Probably because I'm new to all the big data and graph analytics terminologies but the lectures in this chapter were quite difficult to follow in my opinion. The instructor was just talking, not teaching nor explaining, just like someone who prepares notes and is reading to students. The hand-ons were a bit helpful, but overall this class is more for those who already know about the subject.",3
10097,"Concepts are explained in a rather structured way and hands-on with Neo4j are interesting.The last part with GraphX is pure copy-paste of orders, it is disappointing and not a good way to practive.",3
10101,Another good and interesting course but the total lack of engagement by the course team and community mentors makes it hard going.,3
10103,"The professor is well spoken and the class started out very well. But by the final section the hands on example were simply cut-paste with no explanation of what we were doing or how it worked. It's not the fault of the professor but this course and the Big Data specialization attempts to cover too much information. Graph Analytics should be its own 6 course specialization. But really, to understand graph analytics one should be spending a great deal of time with the subject. Perhaps online courses are not the way to understand such a complex subject.",3
10107,Need to include more student project design in the course,3
10124,The course contents are composed of some superficial concepts of cloud computing. And the code framework for programing assignment written in c++ is probably the worst kind of code I've ever seen.,3
10139,"The concepts are explained very well. The only issue was the Programming assignment, which could have been more descriptive. Also, they could've given us the option of choosing a programming language.",3
10154,The instructor's lecture sounded too robotic and I feel like he didn't make any effort to explain some of the principles or simplify the course to the audience. It feels like he just copied concepts and pasted them into the lecture and then read them quick.,3
10184,Very complex and tedious subject.,3
10240,"This was a decent course. Some informative, big picture information but I felt that it lacked some hands on understanding. The minor hands on labs that were provided, were challenging for anyone that is not familiar with Python script writing. I would suggest that you brush up on that before being comfortable with taking this course.",3
10245,"Good overview, but lack in details, lectures are to short. Assignments didn't really reflect the complexity of the content that is taught in the lectures.",3
10275,"The content was very useful. However, a little more detail could have been provided while explaining a few concepts. I am confident of using these frameworks in the future. However, before applying them I will have to visit the material again. Thank you so much.",3
10295,"the language of this video is to high, it's like to be for reading more than speaking ( Too Formal).The Content is quite good, but it needs more time in order to fully understand it.",3
10303,"I think that presentation slides should be offered to students. These slides will cointain information that is given by the expositor. Also, it is possible to offer a toolkit pages in each module to faciltate teaching..",3
10329,"Positive: Approach to the topics is solid, readings are very valuable.Negative: Some videos in week 3 and 4 have audio issues. Course should had a template with the course objectives, learning outcomes and grading scheme. 4 out of 6 quizzes didn't allow to see which questions were right or wrong. Social media resources such as a linkedin group for the specialization would add value. But the most negative aspect was not having the slides. A lot of the topics covered were presented very fast and not having the slides to review the materials made my experience in learning very frustrating. I note that also the course Critical Perspectives on Management had the same problems with the quizzes and also did not provide slides. what was somewhat frustrating also. Also, if IE is making an effort to become more relevant in this online space, it should allocate human resources to monitor and interact in the discussion forums. In my opinion there are a lot of opportunities to improve the student experience. What I found somewhat because being this a series of courses in marketing, a lot of these issues had to been fixed/addressed before the course started...Nonetheless my critics - which I expect to be considered as constructive critics, it is important to thank IE and Coursera for continuing providing online courses.I wish you luck.Ricardo J. Oliveira",3
10332,"A nice course about the MAPS approach and the typical difficulties of natural scientists and mechanical engineers when approaching the political arena and dialoguing with stakeholders. I would like to suggest:1) to change the name in order to make clear that it is about the specific MAPS approach and not about ""climate change mitigation in developing countries"" in general terms.2) to integrate development professionals and some policy analysis / political decision making experts in the revision of the course but also in the MAPS approach in order to make it more effective or relevant for climate governance.3) to include (more) content about low carbon development and climate change mitigation strategies in some key sectors in the development context in order to increase the benefits for students interested in mitigation.4) to reduce the parte about the own difficulties of scientists and engineers when interacting with politics and stakeholders.5) to try to simplify the MAPS approach to make it more accesible to governments and regions in more poor countries.I hope the feedback is useful. Kind regards and thanks very much.",3
10361,Very basic. Could be improved by increasing the level of complexity.,3
10365,Good concise introduction for the topic.,3
10377,"Most of the materials are conceptual, would like to see more real life examples and methods applied.",3
10381,Not the best one on coursera. Included many details that are not really relevant and quizes just checked if you memorized it.,3
10382,An entry level informative course suitable for everyone who wants to have basic understanding in the areas.,3
10390,"It was a basic course which provided insight into basics of Big Data, Cloud and CDN technologies. The lessons are well planned and articulate the subject matter in detail.",3
10391,Simple to understand,3
10409,"somehow I feel the course materials were not prepared well also it was not effective presentation, it was more like a reading a presentation",3
10414,"Good job on the explaining CDN concepts!In the two first modules, the lecturer just read from the slides.",3
10417,It's very helpful to polish my educational skills as a engineer,3
10418,Good Cloud Compyting and CDN lectures and material.Lack of practical examples and use cases in Big Data track.,3
10444,"Course is very basic , although contents are compact and informative.",3
10446,"I found it way too condensed for introduction.I believe it needs to be slowed down, extended - as it is. it is just a blast of facts.",3
10452,Not enough detailed.,3
10456,"Slides were informative, but the lecturer did not add anything to them. One could complete the course by purely reading the slides.",3
10457,Was fully theorytical....Need hands on practical things so that we can do things ourselves,3
10464,CDN topic was very good and well explained.,3
10466,The course was very basic and there was nothing new in the videos compared to the document(PDF) . Instructor was only reading the slides.,3
10467,Excepting some coding on Big Data.,3
10490,"I got understanding about the big data, cloud and CDN. It really help to go further studies in Big data.",3
10497,"Trying to cover many subjects and diving deep into less interesting areas.The lectures themselves are very clear and easy to understand, accompanies with good decks.",3
10509,"It is a good short course to get an idea about Cloud Computing, Big Data and CDN.2 Points to the gentle instructor, Please try to elaborate more outside what is written in the slides. and the other point, please revise the Cloud Computing quiz as it focused on dates and history rather than focusing on the core of the subject.",3
10510,"Good overview of Cloud related technologies. Too many details sometimes about specific providers, something that in my opinion may not be really useful but overall is okay.",3
10538,pretty basic information with lots of repetition. course is short and really can be completed in an evening or two. instructor is knowledgeable. video of lecture doesn't add to presentation. there are few examples or interactive sessions and most of the time the instruction just speaks in front of a chicken cage. if i evaluate this course dispassionately then i don't think there is much difference between watching this course and reading a 5-10 page article.,3
10563,"Good course, I enjoyed learning chemistry! However, the pdf slides could be much better made, since most of them are empty, and the errors in the quiz should be corrected",3
10621,I am concerned about the last assignment of this course. And I cannot get any help from here.,3
10624,"It was a bit.... general. That could be a bias of mine, as I have done quite a bit of management-type work, so maybe it didn't feel that new or informative.",3
10628,"Good overview for those without management experience. For experienced folks -- probably a good number since this is an Executive Data Science course -- it was pretty basic. Also some of the elements come down to management style. For some, other approaches have worked well and might not be ready to switch philosophies based on the course.Otherwise, pretty good.",3
10651,"Content was good and questions were well-thought. Video lectures however would need written notes to accompany them. Also when videos are as long and fast-paced as it is in the course it would be nice to throw the major point in discussion on the background,this would help clarify and focus the idea the lecturer is trying to convey.",3
10657,"needed more depth, which still could have been achieved in a 1-week format",3
10658,"If you know anything about management, specifically software engineering management, this course won't tell you anything new. It's very high level survey of best practices. I'm currently working as a software engineer on data science problems alone on my team. I wanted some idea of how data science teams are typically structured for when I need to talk about my work to my chain of command and my peers and for interacting with other dedicated data science teams at my company. I feel I got a pretty good idea of that and a better understanding the roles in an ideal team. I also feel prepared for the future if I were to apply for a role on a dedicated data science team. As far as actually building a team myself, I think this course won't really give you that if you don't already have other management experience, but it does give you some insight on the specifics of data science people. Finally, Quizzes could use some review, the answers don't often line up grammatically with the questions. Also the one with the instructor's LinkedIn profile linked doesn't work because LinkedIn covers the content and wants you to create an account. A link to a resume or something might be better.",3
10665,"Some of the videos are very basic concepts on how to lead a team (i.e.: Management strategies, common difficulties,...). It is already known things for a manager with some experience leading teams. This course could be shorter.",3
10668,"For most people this might be four stars. There is solid content here, but I couldn't help but feel a lot of this stuff is fairly standard OD/management material and in some ways, it felt like asking, say, a project manager to deliver a data science course. If you have never done any managerial training or read material on intrinsic motivation, org and team culture, then you will get value. For me this was pretty stock",3
10684,There could be more work in the assignments in this course. The Quizzes are very simple.,3
10694,Very short. Quality of the course is OK.,3
10698,"The information is useful, but I think the five courses in the specialization could be merged into a single one.",3
10699,"This was a fine overview however I was hoping to drill down into more detail on some of the roles and responsibilites data teams can have. For example data architects, stewards etc.",3
10709,"Interesting, but content is a bit limited",3
10723,Building a Data Science Team does indeed contain helpful recommendations for starting data science teammanagers/executives; for me it had a little too much of a Hu,3
10725,"Probably, I wouldn't have a course just about how to hire/build a data team.",3
10729,"The courses in the specialization are - in my opinion, excessively short.",3
10734,Good interesting material but the quizzes were badly designed and did not test concepts well.,3
10744,Great idea and syllabus.The videos are too short and missing some explanations.,3
10769,A great course to understand the procedure for non-medicos,3
10778,This serves well as a basic intro but not for people who are looking for a deeper dive.,3
10786,"A little boring. Some lecturers did not deliver a good presentation and some ""philosophical masterpiece"" are not practical at all.",3
10804,Learned a few things from this course.,3
10858,This course was very helpful but there is a need to discuss it more further in details.,3
10861,"This course seems great, although plenty of errors in the audio transcript. The steepness of the learning curve increased very quickly and understandability decreased after week 3, which made me drop the course. I hope to be able to retake it some time in the future with the right mathematical skills.",3
10877,"I was slightly disappointed by the course: too much information was given and not always in a clear way. In particular, sometimes the sessions were jumping from one discipline to another with not much explanation and this was confusing. Also, the information provided was in huge amounts but not in details. I expected to get more detailed information on children's rights while sometimes the presentations were only very general overviews.",3
10882,Good basic coverage on children's fundamental rights. The course could have benefitted from assignments being more consistently accurate to lessons as there are some gaps. The last module I found the most interesting as it covers challenges to child rights in real time cultural/social dilemmas.,3
10902,Too shallow. It's just common sense and a little of vocabulary.,3
10962,"The professor does not evaluate your assignments. Your classmates do, giving you sometimes unfair qualifications. I won't continue with the rest of the course because of that. I think University of Washington or Coursera should have said this at the description of the course so people can decide better if take it or not.",3
10983,"A little to coach ""driven"" for me but good information and tools to use for specific conversations.",3
11039,"While the lectures were good, this course had annoying issues, such as in-video questions asking us to refer to previously shown material (which isn't easy given the Coursera interface). A few assignment questions were also poorly formulated. The course would have really benefited from .pdf reference material, for review and elaboration of topics presented in lectures. At minimum, a list of relevant equations would have helped.The acoustics part of the content seemed somewhat sketchy and hand-wavy; the assumptions and limitations behind the rule-of-thumb equations and models presented weren't given much weight, so I wasn't able to get a good grasp of when they were relevant*. The electronics part was more reasonable, but still suffered from some over-simplification (for example, the model of guitar pickups didn't include magnetic hysteresis).All in all, the course was worth taking, but I think the material deserves more rigor.*All models are wrong. But some of them are useful.",3
11065,Wonderful lectures with heaps of useful information including video on blended teaching in action along with teacher interviews and enthusiastic presenters. The course is self-paced though so you are relying on your fellow learners being up to the point you are for peer assessment. Also some links don't work and there is little or no interaction from the Course leaders or TA's. The lectures are well worth it though.,3
11081,The course content is interesting and well laid out. The lack of contact details for course queries is concerning as is purely being assessed by peers who may not follow the grading guidelines very well (providing no feedback etc),3
11083,"I think the information in this course is well organized and the delivery is good. The video lectures are high quality and there are a number of different people interviewed, each one giving a different opinion on blended learning. Most of the example schools were elementary so it would be better if they could include some secondary schools as well.One area that this course could improve greatly on is the assessments. They are peer-reviewed and I think the rubric used for grading is so strict that it doesn't allow the graders to interpret what we have learned. I also think that some parts of the assessment being measured really aren't important when it comes to us demonstrating what we have learned about blended learning.If you are looking to learn more about blended learning, I would recommend this course.",3
11182,"This is a brief overview, basically food for thought. I liked the small portions this course was broken into, it made it all the more accessible.",3
11210,"I'm leaving because I can't keep up with an 8 week course given in 4 weeks, and even less if the course keep on refering to the 8 weeks time frame. A pity, I loved this course.",3
11211,"The course is all comprehensive about models and concepts of communication science, however the break-down into small lectures turn out to be too brief in my opinion to develop rich understanding of the subject. It would be more conducive that lecturer expands more on the cutting edge study and research, to give people a sense of the finding of the field and its benefits.",3
11227,"The videos lacks clarity, not loud enough and at instances it's ungrammatical.Certainly, there ALWAYS WILL be scope of improvement and although, it was moderately enlightening, thank you for producing this course (quite credibly flexible)",3
11243,Basic but well done,3
11304,"It only gives you a basic overview of start up's vocabulary. However, it is very simple for who has never experienced economics subjects.",3
11306,Great Course. Assignments are the best part of the course.,3
11429,This course mainly focus on statistics and statistical parameters and almost nothing about about Understanding Clinical Research - as title anotate,3
11433,I believe this may be a more helpful course to those already quite familiar with statistics and for those who use statistical terminology daily.,3
11477,Great introduction to the clinical statistic usually encountered while reading medical or biology literature. However it would be much appreciated if more calculations could be incorporate into this course.,3
11502,There are some errors on the quizzes in between the videos. I had to skip a lot of them because it wound't accept the correct answer. I liked the testimonial videos.,3
11513,"a good course, especially if you are not too aware of Autism",3
11529,"In general, I enjoyed the contents of the course. It's a general overview that introduces all aspects of Autism Spectrum Disorder which is exactly what I wanted. However, half of the final week is a list of established and emerging practices, so this was quite boring. I could have read them off the screen faster.My least favorite aspect of this course is that you can't take the quizzes without buying the certificate. Currently, the certificate won't assist me; I simply wanted to learn more about ASD so as to be more informed. This was quite frustrating because I use the quizzes as a means of checking my understanding and retention of the material.",3
11535,Good introduction to ASD.,3
11542,"The course had some useful content, but there was too much time spent on USA centred materials for an iavailabe course.",3
11567,Could be more computer friendly. Had good information but hard to engage because the majority of the lectures are just powerpoints with the professor talking over them.,3
11577,Very helpful information particularly in the earlier weeks. I found the last couple weeks less helpful because of the large quantity of listed interventions without elaboration/examples - I did read the attached report but would have found it helpful to see some of the interventions demonstrated either via a video or diagram. Temple Grandin is a great documentary and I appreciated hearing her perspective regarding tactile sensitivity. She's also a great example of a person with autism who has developed her strengths and worked around her weaknesses and is a highly functional and successful individual. Overall enjoyed this class. Thanks!,3
11612,Good way to get started with doing from just listening or reading.,3
11615,"it was good, could be more dinamic though",3
11619,Learn something about the money supply and demand and their relationship with the exchange rate. but can hardly used in daily,3
11621,The content covers very good the most important theories and concepts in macro economy and explains in detail the relationship between them. I wish the course would take more advantage of interactive multimedia tools in order to support the spoken word with visual means.,3
11626,"This is a good course, but be sure you have a foundational level of understanding of Macroeconomics before starting - it doesn't provide a lot of background before diving into more advanced topics.",3
11634,"I thought at first according to the title of this course, that it should be an intro for c programmers. But it is more like a brush-up for already c++ programmers. Be ready to take some other course or reading parallel. Otherwise the homeworks are absolutely interesting and suitable for new-comer. It would be better if more videos with more details could be made.",3
11647,"It accomplishes the main goal: help with the leap from C to C++, but:- It's damn slow. I had to use the 1.5x or 2x speed all the time, and I'm not native English.- The format of the slides is really ugly (e.g., those bullet points in the code)- No lecture notes are provided- The references are to his (expensive) books instead- No source code of examples is provided either- Graph theory is interesting, but out of scope. Waste of time for those who already know it are not interested in and just want to learn C++. It would be better to provide references for optional reading or reviewing.",3
11649,"Do this course for the assignments and to have something that keeps you on schedule. But be prepared to do your own research on topics.The professor goes off on pointless tangents forever. C is also supposed to be a prerequisite but then he ends also ends up explaining basic C (prefixing his explanation with you should know this). He then goes into these very specific, typical academic-style examples that he spends time talking about them (again pointless). And then very little time is left to explain the actual new C++ stuff, and he explains it assuming you kind-of know what he's talking about. So you'll have to stop the video and look up the topic online.",3
11657,"The course presents the topics in a non-linear manner. It should be called ""Learning graphs with C++""",3
11669,"The course content is good. But it needs some polishing...Major comment:The assignment submission/review process should be improved. Grading system is not clearly defined at the time of submission. Some grading question are inherently subjective ""Is the code at least somewhat efficient?"". But even for inherently objective questions ""Is the code correct?"" (as does it give the correct answer"" the staff does not provide the correct answer... I think the staff should create some automated review for what is objective: does the code compile? does it yield the correct answer? is it efficient enough? (Just like many other courses on Coursera) And only when it passes the automatic review, use peer grading for coding style. Finally there a lot of confusion with the deadlines.Minor comments:Lucky Coursera has an option to play twice faster! Not that the content is too easy, but the talking ... pace ... is ... hum... very ... ... slow. Also how come for a programming course the slides with code are so poorly formated???",3
11684,Not enough depth. Put another way not a CS course.,3
11715,Somewhat basic and not very applicable,3
11761,"presentation is poor, not very engaging",3
11819,A bit too short.,3
11846,"It was pretty intuitive and easy to follow the first couple of weeks, but then the assumed knowledge of beta and gamma distributions and their frequentist usage, stood in the way of me fully grasping the Bayesian part of it. In the end I just copied the examples from the lectures and passed the tests ... without really getting it.",3
11848,"It was little difficult to understand what the professor , but anyway it was good.",3
11862,This course requires solid grounding in mathematics. No meant of Social Science graduates without proper training in statistics/mathematics. The course was good in the sense that we could how probability distributions are used to model real world problems.Study material was certainly not adequate.,3
11889,"Liked the course, but it was a little easy (took four days total to do the material for the whole course). Many questions were left unanswered (such as how dependent the credibility intervals are on the choice of prior distribution and the assumed distribution of the data), and it didn't touch on later topics that are interesting (MCMC sampling). Again, good beginning course, but I was looking for more in depth study.",3
11893,"The lectures from week 1 to week 3 are nice and useful to me, but I think there should be more details about the content in week 4. For example, I think the lecture about the Jeffreys prior skipped many things and I did not understand this concept very well.",3
11901,"The material is good, but I've found the lectures challenging to understand even having some background in math. It would be good if all the definitions and key facts were stated more prominently in the lectures, as opposed to algebraic transformations which most readers can hopefully do on their own.",3
11959,The course content is good but sometimes very fast paced. The downside of the course relates to the peer-review system of some of the assignments. You can get stuck with a failed assignment for weeks and you have to kindly ask in the forums for someone to review it.,3
11962,Interesting course! But the lecture videos are too long.,3
11977,"good for people who don't have any background about coding, and want to build a prototype of an app",3
11985,Nice Lesson and good subject,3
12016,Course content good but labs difficult to work with as no offline unit tests were provided which made debugging painful.,3
12030,"Course has very good content and well structured. However it lacks more details on the mechanics, under the hood functioning of Blockchains.The practical assignments are not adequate. Propose more exercises that goes up in incremental content and difficulties and allow students to get more practical insight upon how a blockchain really works.",3
12031,Nice course with troublesome assignments.,3
12040,"Great overview of Bitcoin, solid foundation in Blockchain. This industry is fast moving so its a bit dated with its content -- for example, this was done before Ethereum so it is not mentioned at all. Needs to be updated. Plus -- no certificate dings it one more for me...",3
12052,"It is difficult to complain too much about a free course, but I expected more from a course carrying the name Princeton. The videos were generally well done and interesting, but did contain factual errors almost every week.Unfortunately the instructors were absent from the forums after a couple replies the first week. The homework assignments were disorganized, provided components contained errors, the grading system had problems and the requirements were often unclear. The assignments require Java programming experience (not mentioned in course description). Most importantly, the assignments in no way reflected what was taught in the course videos. They were of course related, but were implementing parts of a bitcoin node, but in a simplified manner. The textbook PDF is good.It would have been nice to have assignments working with real bitcoin (or testnet) transactions, sigs, verification, hashing, etc.Anyhow, I'm enthusiastic about this subject matter, so I'm just happy the course exists, but don't expect a glossy polished course... it's a rough ride.Here is another Bitcoin course that looks good: https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/bitcoin-decentralized-technology",3
12065,"The course is comprehensive and covers technical, social, economic. legal aspects of Bitcoin. The technical treatment is hands on and gives a really good fell for how bitcoin and blockchain works compared to several other sources where treatment is superficial.There are several parts of the course I was not able to get a clear understanding - such as implementation of the actual bitcoin core in the stack based script. Also I found the questions for the programming assignments convoluted and not very helpful in describing what is required from the student. Had it not been for discussions on the student forum I would not have been able to complete the final assignment.Despite the shortcomings I would recommend this for someone who is good in Java and would like to get a technical as well as comprehensive understanding of cryptocurrencies and blockchain.",3
12078,Assignments would need to be improved...,3
12146,"Given the nature of law courses (a lot of reading), there needs to be a great deal more written information on the lecture slides. Quotes from pieces of legislation, judgements from various courts, quotes from politicians etc. need to be provided on the slides, otherwise students are either left to search through the transcript, which contains numerous spelling and grammatical errors, or write what Prof. Gearey is saying which means continuously stopping and starting the lectures to get it all down. IN SHORT: Better lecture slides with more information on.",3
12152,"The content is good, but it's lacking articles, important bills etc..; and the quizzes aren't very hard",3
12178,"Useful course for exposure to debates that animate the common law, with some bits about the relationship of English and European law, pre-Brexit. It's probably fair to say this course offers some experience in the elusive skill of how to think like a lawyer. The legal debates might seem a bit pedantic to all but the specialist. For example, the course attempts to sketch in the debates about proper use of precedent, with frequent reminders that the task of fully developing such debates is beyond the scope of the course--I'll bet some students were thinking, thank goodness it's beyond the scope. It's all clear enough, and delivered pretty much exclusively in traditional lecture format--there's even a lectern. Each of these lessons about the legal debates outlines and develops the opposing sides but doesn't give you a whole lot of new content to be tested. Thus, many of the quiz questions are on comprehending passages from cases, statutes, or commentary. Such quiz questions sometimes feel like those reading comprehension questions from a standardized test, rather than tests of the material covered in the lesson.",3
12188,"Interesting material and good teacher but very poor use of the media (an audio file would have been sufficient for most lectures) and low quality recording for some lectures (background noises, echos, wind...)",3
12199,I need access to the quizzes,3
12202,"It wasn't challenging but more irrelevant to what I'd guess is a lot of ""workplaces""",3
12212,"While the course materials themselves were very useful, the quizzes didn't feel like an effective test of the material and consisted of very few questions, which didn't leave room for error (especially problematic because some questions were subjective).",3
12213,I like the course content but the presenter needs to have a more friendly way to present it.,3
12214,"Kinda disappointed that in a course about Communication, Margaret can be such a ""so-so"" communicator herself. Except that, the course is good and offers some cool tips on how to deal with that new ways of communication that we must deal of.",3
12224,"The extra/outside content provided is great. As others have stated, but clearly not adjusted, some of the quiz questions aren't clear items covered in the material (which is frustrating).",3
12243,It is basic course with simple information,3
12244,"I think that , this course need to add more keys critical important point in each lesson by keywords on Videos. And examples how to use these skill on nature life",3
12249,"speak speed is little bit too quick, difficult for non-english speaking student",3
12257,"A good introduction to Workplace Communication.The resources supplied were extremely helpful.I didn't pay so much attention to the slides that came with this - in fact, I'm not even sure how relevant they are looking back.I had expected the overview videos to be an insight to the resource content, but it wasn't quite compiled that way.The tests could have been longer, and perhaps could have contained obvious solutions - in some instances the solutions provided were all applicable, leaving the student to select the best option. In other instances the options available weren't even discussed in the content, confusing the student.",3
12259,Has good collection of resources for improvement of communication skills,3
12260,"The teacher of this course talks toooo fast ! I`m for example a french educated student, so I prefer to take courses with a teacher who talks in a comprehensive way in which I can understand everything he says in order to proceed in my work and then to benefit everything in this course.Concerning the quiz, in the all of the quiz there is questions not related to what already said from the teacher or in the articles required to read. I red the articles coupes of time but in a specific questions, the answers, it seems, that we should answer from our own memory because badly it`s not mentioned in any article or in the video of the teacher.Thanks",3
12269,Less required reading and more targeted lectures would make it great. It often seemed that the questions in the quiz weren't properly covered in the material provided.,3
12275,the course is not that strong when it comes to communicating with direct reports .,3
12277,"Ok course. Well tught, but overall I prefer more business related classes.",3
12281,materials/lectures are brief and could go deeper.,3
12282,It's a bit hard to answer the quiz since the presentation is not speaking about the qu,3
12288,"Gives just enough info. Great, but I wish it was more detailed.",3
12401,"A little slower than the last ones, not my favorite but great use of hands-on projects and enagagement",3
12411,"The course was good enough...but exercises were very simple. Only the final course was little bit challenging. For a guy that sits in IT business for a while it's rather too simple. Besides, I've learned spark basics which is super cool...so thanks for thatMaybe you could consider to build docker image instead of using virtual machines. VM is ok, but I think that docker can simplify all the stuff without necessary downloading, installations etc.Looking forward to the next spark challenges :)",3
12416,"Programming instructions were not clear, and the version of Python that was installed on my machine did not support the Jupy",3
12419,"some of the stuff was not mentioned properly, like for last quiz how to expoert data from mongodb",3
12432,"I feel the contents of this course were great, no second thought on it. It makes your concepts crystal clear. But faced lots of issues during practicing the hands on exercises and did not get proper feedback or response on any of the queries.",3
12441,"The final assessment somewhat not really well designed, imho.",3
12442,Needs more depth. Instructors should reference more external readings since the lectures are brief.,3
12443,Good experience of using the big data tools but a total lack of engagement in the forums by the instructors and community mentors make it hard going if anything goes wrong. The final quiz took me over 8 hours mostly because there was no one to ask for hints when I was totally stuck and confused!,3
12509,"The content is helpful in learning to use the camera and understand terminology, but it is somewhat, if not totally, a false representation of interaction with the experts. There is absolutely none. Some seems repetitive from course one.",3
12522,"Sorry but yet again a potentially great course spoiled by the implementation, way too many mistakes in the quizzes, peer review grading systems which in places are nonsense . I hope things get better and I give the the course the 5 stars the content would merit if it had been properly QCed and delivered to best Coursera standards",3
12524,The glitches with Coursera itself are not excusable and should be taken as a black mark against the organization. They made the professors and Michigan State look less than average and caused confusion among the students. The material is good and it makes me learn about the camera that I use and try new things.,3
12537,problems..problems ongoing,3
12540,"The explanations are a bit and drawn out. For non-native English speakers, this is very difficult to understand as well at time difficult for native speakers. Also, the course for auditors is not very interactive and we cannot participate in some quizzes and work submission.",3
12562,needs more info and practical references,3
12571,"The course content is very good and useful. But the so-called ""Chinese version"" doesn't fit my need. It takes longer time for me to understand the quiz and find more information relative to the quiz items from Chinese materials. Exactly the course itself is clear enough to understand, but the quiz part doubles the difficulties to comprehend.",3
12661,Very basic things... Any examples for regression.,3
12672,It's ok for an extremely high-level overiew,3
12713,Extremely lightweight and totally missing in substance; I cannot recall whether they stated so in the course goals.,3
12714,The comparaison between Chinese and Western Culture was really useful. It was a nice overview but it would also have been interesting to get information (at least some ints) about the long and fascinating Chinese History. More historical context would be appreciated.,3
12745,The course gives a clear and means ideas about how communicate in works areas.,3
12747,The audio quality of the lectures could be better. Assignments need to be challenging. Programming assignments in Assembly should be used to evaluate the grade in addition to quizzes.,3
12765,I enjoyed the topic. The lectures could be augmented by breaking them up into more pieces (particularly for Instrumental variables and double difference). It would have been nice if additional (optional) readings were listed to give interested students more direction. I also would have liked to see topics added to the course such as propensity score matching.,3
12767,This give a very good insight into what i did not know earlier. Thank you Prof. Anders Holm. I recommend this course to all all. I did a lot of learning. Go for it,3
12768,"It teaches an interesting topic, but it's a bit hard to follow the teacher. I learnt from the exercises, mostly.",3
12830,Quiz isn't challenging enough to validate the understanding of the user taking the course .,3
12831,Basic course with videos running too fast......,3
12833,"I do feel that I learned from this course, though I almost feel that it was too easy to earn the certificate.",3
12839,The free course is very short and only give a generalized information of the cybersecurity word. I can't review about the full course (but you should pay for it).,3
12843,This course was really good but not too deep. I went on to study the CISSP manual and some additional training. This is a great course if you want an introduction to cybersecurity.,3
12859,Course material reference readings were good but videos were pathetic. It was more like a high school kid reading the slides.,3
12868,It is not any technical 'lab based exercise bases I mean',3
12872,"too short, I prefer that the engineer share a little experience or make more in detail.",3
12892,Too little course material; video's too flashy (noisy) and do not discuss enough information,3
12901,I wish that the videos were longer.,3
12915,The course content does not follow the exam question is totally different what you learn from the two-minute video. You need to have the background in the field. This course should have gone through the beta test before release to the public.,3
12917,"The subject matter is very interesting, the reading material is well-chosen, but the video lectures are superficial, to put it mildly. I recommend doing th course, but strongly suggest the staff upgrade the lectures.",3
12918,"I Felt like this was a very in depth course, the reading material was very good. At times I thought the instructional videos were very short - I would have liked them to have been longer, perhaps going into more depth about some of the topics covered in the reading materials - I was not fond of the written portion of the course - I would have preferred exams to the written portion.thanks.",3
12920,"A good course for people who are trying to lean the basics of cyber security.Regards,Kashif",3
12931,"Too microsoft-oriented, too much reading (sometimes not very related to the topic) that is not unique and can be easily found on the internet without attending this course, not enough video presentations and explanations.Final exam seemed to me a bit out of topic.",3
12933,"A little bit too much generalist, need more precision.And unlimited attempt for quizz is not a godd idea, because quizz don't mean anything",3
12942,"I find this course very informative, but at the same time the videos seem pointless. All the quizzes are on the suggested reading material. The videos are quite cursory- almost an afterthought.",3
12946,Good basic course,3
12948,The material may be nore specific,3
12955,I found the course interesting though the continual music being played in the background was a distraction for me and felt like a brainwashing exercise.,3
12963,"It's not exactly I was expecting. It covers lot of theory part. Some practical work in coding and security practicles would have added more value.I enjoyed the some material pdf suggested. However, I didn't liked ""Accordingly to Microsoft"" question and material. It was made 10 years back. Course content must be updated and more invovled tasks or discussions with Course makers. It looks like some videos are once made and kept as it is. I never saw actual teachers teaching something in this course, just browsing, reading and eassy writing.",3
12971,Is a little basic introduction to InfoSEC but is nice a good to start.,3
12981,"The course isn't bad, but the videos explanations are all way to general, they should be more detailed.",3
13033,"At first the questions were wrong, but i contacted with the professor and he corrected them.",3
13074,it was too much teory and not really data analytics tools.,3
13088,"While I appreciated the challenge of the capstone project, I didn't feel like the assignment's requests accurately aligned or represented what was provided in the lecture series. As someone who bought this course as one large pack (four courses, one capstone project), it would've been nice to see more intersection. I felt a little ""in the dark"" on some of this. Given the short timeline to finish the work, too, many of these requests need more time (e.g. building personas needs user research, ideally). All in all, a good challenge to a content professional, but don't expect all of this to align with what you learned in the lecture series.",3
13197,Would have rated it 4 if i had received my certificate of accomplishment like i was told at the starting of the course. The course was very informative and explained thoroughly and all but when you put it down on your resume or something its good to have a document backing up the claim.,3
13199,"So far , very interesting and covers much of the material that was covered in my Strategy Course in my MBA. It has been a delightful course as a refresher and putting more up-to-date examples than when I covered much of this material some time ago. Have another 2.5 weeks to go but I will look for more courses from LMU & Tobias !",3
13284,"Good introductory class to the topic. Much time spent on examples. However, each module feels somewhat a bit disconnected from the other ones. A case study or example which would navigate students through all 6 modules would greatly help students remembering it all.",3
13314,Not a lot of practice problems and somewhat superficial information.,3
13317,Good Attractiveness,3
13391,The course introduces us to a ton of valuable material for developing data products. But it is up to the student to have the initiative to dig deeper into the material by going through the various API reference documentations in order to create the final data applications. I'm not sure there is a better way to teach this course; but it felt like I was left to my own devices to complete the course. In a way it was a good learning experience to have to complete the assignments without much hand-holding from the instructors.,3
13400,A bit fast paced as they teach so many things in a single week. But the stuff they teach is surely great and makes you appreciate the beauty of R,3
13409,"Although I really liked the content of this course, the videos seemed to be have been done with rush. Many of the explanations were started but not finished and the presenter had many breaks during his speech to think or to go back with a better explanation.",3
13416,"Nice course, but the discussion forum are not the same as in the old format. I also think that the shiny videos from Rstudio are better than the instructional videos in this course.",3
13426,"This module is not the same level as the previous ones, giving a superficial view of several package but not on any deepens. The application development was the positive part of the module.",3
13432,"The course is fine in the content. As usual, the presentation from Brian Caffo is rather rushed and stumbling. A better presenting style would improve the course no end, but ultimately, what is covered is what you need. I generally just avoid the videos and read the slides.",3
13434,This course isn't as clearly outlined or carefully prepared as the others in the Data Visualization specialization.,3
13440,"The class was OK. This was the topic I was most excited to get to in the specialization, so I started playing around with Shiny, Slidify, and other tools ahead of time. Because I had gained some basic familiarity with those packages, this class was a bit of a letdown. I was happy with the week on making R packages. That was all new and fascinating. If you're looking for something more advanced than a very basic overview, you may want to look elsewhere.",3
13457,"The course is OK, but I'd rather learned app development with Python or Java.",3
13458,Updated and entertaining!!,3
13463,Lots of material in a short amount of time.,3
13475,I have not received yet my certificated and I can't see it in the list. Is there something wrong?,3
13494,Algorithms in lectures were useless to programming assignment,3
13499,For a beginner like me its totally going over the head. I mean i get the logic but if you guys can please give more code...I am learning data structures for the first time and it is bit difficult for me to grasp it all and write codes in a week...,3
13567,"Course content is ok, but some lectors are really boring in explaining mathematical details.Tasks are pretty easy, and this is from algorithmic perspective, because from programming there are almost nothing to do.And overall it feels that there are not so much info as for 5 weeks course. If it would cost lest, than it would be ok. But for 80$ I've expected more.",3
13569,"[Slightly updated according to Michael's questions]The course is fine, but comparing to the previous one - Algorithmic Toolbox - this one is weaker and with lesser quality.Pros: the course contains some interesting data structures and valuable observations. The starter files for assignments are in place. Related books are given after each video session. All the tasks have automatic grader. There is a couple of interesting tasks to do.Cons: the material is mostly lectures, and there is even a video where lecturer just reads the article from Wiki (Splay tree - has the same information with same lack of some proofs). Expected: add quizzes as it was in the first course. The course has less weeks - only 4 as comparing to 5 in AT. So various important data structures are not discussed. The course has less homework - 3 tasks each week as comparing to 5 in AT. And all 3 are usually just implementations of some basic algos seen in lectures.I consider the course valuable due to a number of good videos and a couple of good tasks to do. But in general, this course has the area for improvement.",3
13580,"The depth and explanation of theoretical concepts are better than the first course. I like the in depth discussion over various introduced data structures, for instance there are comparisons between naive implementations vs smarter implementations. However overall the topic is very theoretical, maybe add a little more connection of each introduced data structure with respect to its application would make the topic less dry and more motivating.",3
13587,"The course has excellent homework to help you study, but the course itself sometimes doesn't cover more generally applied knowledge such as red-black BST. Also, the professors' teaching style may be confusing sometimes and require extra work to understand, especially when they didn't have a pen in hand and were just talking quickly to the air. I do hope the following series will eventually tackle these issues, and I'll be glad to give the whole series 5 stars.",3
13589,"The structure of the class follows the regular academic model you'll find in college: lecture -> lecture -> lecture -> assignment... repeat. I don't think this model is suitable for online delivery. Without discussion and the ability to interrupt and ask questions, the lectures are at times a more frustrating than useful (especially with Coursera's user interface, which lacks quick rewind and is generally speaking rather poorly thought out).For many of the topics, better videos exist online (try safari or pluralsight). As for the problems, they were the main source of learning, but were also at times a bit frustrating (the splay trees starter code was rather sad to look at). I find that hacker rank is probably better at delivering value (if you can forego the warm fuzzy feeling you get from getting a verified certificate, you'll probably be better served by practicing on hacker rank than from doing the problems in this course).",3
13605,"I was hoping the lectures would be more dense. My previous coursera courses where on data science, machine learning, etc. I somewhat feel that the content on those courses is twice or thrice more.",3
13615,"This course got better as it went on. The first week, the teacher went through the entire plot of Harry Potter which seemed like a waste of time. The point was made long before the telling of every plot point in Harry Potter was done. I thought, really, I signed up for four months of this? Then the lectures got better, learning the basis outlines and structures of plot is useful. Simple, but useful.",3
13649,it seems good and hopefully will be valuable in my context,3
13654,"The course material and videos are very good, however I would prefer that comments about your work be emailed directly to the student so that they are more likely to read them. I found it to easy to just move on and not really look for the comments on my work.",3
13658,it would have been great if the final assignment had been grade,3
13670,"I learnt much but only rated 3 stars because students are unable to submit their assignments or receive peer group or mentor feedback unless a payment is made. The previous writing course I completed with Coursera did not have such restrictions - you only had to pay for the certificate if wanted. However, thank you for free access to the content",3
13682,"I understand the importance of reviewing other classmates work however with the time constraints of today's world, I believe it takes away from precious time that could be spent developing the craft of writing .",3
13708,The course is nice and informative. Unfortunately one can not do any of the pear rated assignments or pear reviews.,3
13711,"Nice, informative, but basic and short.",3
13753,"I found this course quite hard to take to; especially after starting the second one on Character. Saying that though, it is good to learn about different perspectives and approaches as education whatever form enables us to move forward on our learning path.",3
13758,"-Made on 10/05/2016- Low quantity of information and resources. For the cost , is not even near to other moocs. Block the sending and sharing of activities, and unable the peer evaluation because of a required payment, really handicap the learning and the quality of the course. If I pay a Mooc, is becouse of a strong quality and substantial learning; this two lacking in this course. I can give you a list of other moocs around this and other subjects (film, writing, mat, entrepreneurship, photography...) for you to make relations and compare structures. Please revise this course, you have nice video edition and the teacher is good, and willing to teach, but the global course is missing several things. I encourage you to take my words.",3
13767,The problem is that the only feedback a student gets is from other students. I only received 1 feedback from the supposedly 3 each week for 4 weeks. I gave 3 stars because the videos are very good and good concepts but I paid far more money than they now charge. So I doubt I will finish the certificate because the final course relies only on student feedback which is non-existent.,3
13779,So overly simple with a lack of details in the steps.,3
13780,"Overall, I sincerely think this course was useful to me. I did learn, and that is great. I got some good advice from the reviewers. And I appreciated most of the videos, especially the shop talks.But I wish the instructor or his staff were more present in the discussion area, and I would have preferred a better written material. The transcripts are not formatted. They are completely raw and difficult to use.Furthermore, I don't think it is normal that people duly registered to the class have difficulties to get their 3 reviews. Too many people have to ask for it in the forums.In conclusion, a good course with good video material, but a lack of presence and organization.",3
13798,"I did learn. However, some info could of been better explained. I felt like some videos didn't really further my knowledge. And the lack of communication on the discussions by the professor, was quite unbelievable. More participation by the professor would be appreciated. I do understand there's many people doing this, but if other can, why couldn't he? Maybe have an assistant?Otherwise, like I said, I did learn a lot and I do appreciate it.",3
13817,"The videos are quite interesting, though I think they are overly committed to very specific techniques. I did not, however, find the assignments and peer review system very helpful. People had a tendency, particularly on the first assignment, to read in requirements that were not actually stated or written down and failed people accordingly. There also does not seem to be enough people to review all of the assignments, either--perhaps due to the paywall for assignments. The very nature of the peer review system also guarantees you see a real range on the individual criteria you are evaluated on and the depth of the review. This exacerbates the very harsh ""0 or 1"" point option for all assignments (i.e. either you get a 1 and pass or you get a 0 and fail).Bottom line: I think the course materials are useful and at the very least interesting for developing writers, but I'm not sure it's worth the $79 entry fee to gain access to the peer review, unless you really need or want the course certificate.",3
13819,Someone needs to review/proofread the final part and assignment. Many students were/are confused about the final assignment. Revise the video too.,3
13838,"For prospective students who are looking to enter the biostatistics/epidemiology field in the future. This course is designed as an in depth fundamentals of biostatistics where Professor Brain Caffo dives deep into some of the key formulas, origins of statistical formulas, and theoretical aspects of statistics.Great lecture with valuable information, however, due to the lack of engagement within the lectures, it absolutely leave students who have no background of Calculus or Linear Algebra in the dust with no reference to assist them in the course. Once or if a student has a solid foundation for the topics covered in this course, this information is very insightful and understandable.you might ask yourself, someone who doesn't have a prior knowledge of the material covered in the course if you should even take part in the course, my answer would still be yes, so long as you are willing take notes, save the videos, and return back to them at a later point once you build yourself up by studying calculus, statistics, and/or linear algebra.",3
13848,I need to have a class. I really think this course could hel me a lot.,3
13850,"The material and presentation are at the highest level, but the course is lacking real life examples, and contexts.",3
13863,Quizzes are not challenging enough,3
13869,"It's only enter-level for people who don't know R. For those who already used R, it's not a good choice.",3
13886,There is a pretty big jump from the content to actually completing the assignment. The assignments are not well aligned with the swirl learning or the videos. There is no logical process taught about how to move forward if you get stuck. It often means a student is forced to search the internet and hope the answer they find is appropriate so they can write their own code.,3
13895,"It's a good introductory course, but it's very basic and I feel that I paid a lot for a very basic experience. I do understand it is the first step in a full specialization but I think it can be more challenging.",3
13909,Very basic introductory course. Looking forward to the other modules.,3
13918,It was a good overview. I understand that it’s really just a quick intro into upcoming specialization courses. I wouldn’t take it alone. But I’m excited for the rest of the courses!,3
13921,too easy,3
13923,"Mostly preparatory material and setup activities for the rest of the series. It's OK, but not a revelation.",3
13941,Too little information and too basic.,3
13946,This course is a good start to give an overview on the toolbox you should be aware of to specialize in Data science or analysis. You don't need 4 weeks to complete to complete it! At best you could complete within a week or 2 days. Best of luck!,3
13952,The git and GitHub section is not very clear....,3
13959,Probably a good course if you aren't terribly familiar with GIT or some form of version control. It also helps to get all the tools in place to be ready for the other courses.,3
13988,Good starter setup. Looking forward to the technical portion of the Specialization.,3
13990,"Not a bad intro; I don't know if anyone would benefit taking this as a standalone (or for an entire 4 weeks, for that matter). Still, it introduced some solid concepts for professionals and scholars, alike.",3
13999,Very basic introduction...,3
14001,The word 'toolbox' made me think there was more in the course. 'Introduction' or maybe' Overview ' may have been more accurate. Good course otherwise.,3
14003,"This is a good, general introduction. A motivated student can run through it very, very quickly. As the first of ten courses, I understand that it is a very general introduction. Still, I think it could be ramped up a bit. Week 2 of the next course - R programming - is kind of a kick in the head if you're not a programmer. I feel like some of the content from R programming could have be included in the toolbox course in order to take advantage of the relatively light load.",3
14015,"Too little substance, though I do expect the rest of the series to be good as I take this as a setup course and my expectations for those are high. Having said that, perhaps it would be wise to charge less for this initial course or even offer it for free.",3
14019,"Though the course itself is introductory in nature, i wish there was a lecture on what and how exactly are these going to be useful with the help of a real life example and also an increase in the depth of the content.",3
14035,"Too basic, not very informative. Waste of money.",3
14048,"Good for a beginners course, could be a little more challenging.",3
14065,"it could have been better if it was more hands-on learning, for instance I don't understand why did we learn CLI till now and how will I link it to my studies",3
14077,"Good course, but worth only for really basic learners.",3
14078,Very basic overview of the tools and installation of them. Should be an optional course rather than part of the specialization.,3
14090,Too little material for 4 weeks. All this could've been written in a PDF instead of videos.,3
14102,This course didn't teach me much about Data Science or the different areas to pursue after this introductory course. I probably could have got as much out of it as following the tutorials on GitHub and the new desktop tool. Following the tutorial which was made for windows was also a bit annoying at times. Finally I had to wait weeks to have my assignment marked and there is still conflicting information on the course page - in 'grades' it shows I didn't pass the week 4 task. On other pages it shows I did and earned 41 out of 41 points. However I can't see a confirmation of course completion.,3
14107,Pretty basic stuff.,3
14128,Couldn't hear the videos,3
14133,"A good intro to the tools, but for anyone with prior programming experience unnecessary",3
14142,There is a slight lack of clarity in videos in terms of audio and also in terms of what exactly the author/lecturer is trying to convey.,3
14167,"Pretty simple, the Univ of Michigan Data Science with Python set the bar pretty high.",3
14168,"Some video explanations are not so clear, so will be great to highlight some concepts, theory and methods or technical (with some reading), also will be great exhibit the latest news about toolbox(that is the current topic) or data scientists",3
14174,"nothing special, no significant knowledge gained.",3
14175,Github exposition is a little complicated. I believe it could be more detailed. But the rest is very well done!,3
14187,The course is too short and I didn't learn much.,3
14192,"Not really a course, should just be Week 1 in course 2",3
14212,Good overview. Helpful introduction to topics covered in the specialization.,3
14213,Doing this course first doesn t make you anticipate how difficult could this speciality in the next courses :p,3
14236,"Instructor speaks very fast so that i read subtitles instead of hearing what he say, in addition to i stop video more times to understand what he say, but totally the scientific and technical contents are great also his advises for us in which how we can find the answers for our questions about data science",3
14240,"Super basic, each week was only about 30 minutes of video lecture... but I think that was their goal? Bad form on coursera for making you pay to submit assignments that are autograded to begin with.",3
14262,A very good for beginners.,3
14266,Basic introduction to the specialization. It was way too simple for me since I already have knowledge in machine learning.,3
14271,"Really tough to review this class outside of the context of the other elements of the data scientist specialization. What was presented was straight-forward and quite well done. After I know how well prepared we are for next classes, I will re-evaluate.",3
14277,Basic introduction to data science.,3
14283,There wasn't much to learn that I didn't already know. There was a lot of talk but no real practical application (I guess except for github for people that didn't know how to use that).,3
14286,"Too simple, too easy",3
14288,"Not much of a course, I understand why it exists, but it's basically just getting setup with the environment. Almost not worthy of course status.",3
14291,Good for starters..,3
14307,"Not really specific, just a broad indtroduction to data analysis.",3
14309,"Quite basic - but good overview of general theory. Don't do this on its own, it's quite useless as a standalone module",3
14315,"The course goes over the basic toolkit for data scientists. Overall it seemed too easy and maybe a bit simplistic. I was expecting more. There was a lot of optional reading made available in week 1, perhaps some optional assignments/quizzes related to that reading could be added to the course.",3
14316,Audio on videos was sometimes unclear. Course content was interesting.,3
14318,"Thank you for the fantastic effort. Here's some constructive feedback on the course.It's a very basic course, could have included more material. Also, the audio quality is not that great. To make it better, I'd Include more walkthroughs for Git and GitHub.",3
14319,It was a great start to data science but also students should have it in mind that the material presented in the course won't be enough to get through it.,3
14332,illustration is not enough for the commands. More schematic description could help understanding the course much better.,3
14357,"Just an introduction, not so great.",3
14376,"very helpful but i think it is too short, i need some more concepts to fully understand what these tools used for",3
14382,Covered basic elements of data science and statistics.,3
14396,"Gives a good overview of topics and the specialisation, however is still very basic. I'm looking forward to the next advanced courses",3
14410,There is practically nothing in this course to learn. It can be termed as a introduction to the specialization,3
14412,"Interesting, but could be improved with further applications.",3
14422,"This course sets the stage for the rest of the Data Science specialisation.You get a lot of textbooks for free and they cover a lot of material.The quizzes are a little bit underwhelming, especially the first week. Too few questions, testing some questionable knowledge (eg, what other courses there are in the specialisation -- hardly a required tool in the data scientist's box).Overall, it's a good preparation for what is to come. It managed to whet my appetite for more , however I'm not sure the course is very useful on its own.",3
14424,Very. Very. Very Easy.,3
14452,"I think the course was too superficial and didn't cover enough topics to be a standalone course. It could be part of a greater course. My feeling is that this wasn't worth $30 dollars, and that such a small course was put together just to charge for one more module.",3
14455,It is a very basic course to give you high level of what the course is going to cover and the tools that will be used throughout the course. If you have much programming background this course will be a breeze.,3
14467,concepts were very good but teaching method/material must improve...some of the materials and methods used are too unstable to be useful for professional use...more work should be done by instructors to separate the 'reliable' concepts/info from 'interesting to know but not ready for mass use',3
14474,Good course for Starters,3
14476,"The first course is composed in articulate way that allows a simple and schematic way of comprehension, but some single parts of the first course seem to be lacking of some information, above all to me without previous experience in informatics tools like github. Maybe I suppose to master this tools too long in advance.",3
14483,"It is not clear enough for a greenhand to understand, especially about installing Git on Mac or pushing files to Github.",3
14494,"Good introduction, but the professor could have been more descriptive about how to use git/github. These are new concepts for people so it may be difficult to grasp right away.",3
14501,"too easy,i wish we had more things do submit so we will learn more",3
14504,The introduction of how to use github is undetailed in my opinion.,3
14512,"The course is too easy to be called a course. Just an easy intro, which you can complete in a couple of days.",3
14519,"Well presented, but this course should be optional in in the specialization. There isn't really enough material to justify it, but it does cover the basics for someone with little to no development experience.",3
14523,"It is a good introductory course, but it could be optional for people with some experience in the field, as it is very basic.",3
14525,This one is just a warm up for the Data Science Specialization.,3
14551,"This is a really basic course. If you have never touch code before, it's more useful, but little is actually covered here and the gap between it's contents and the next class, R programming is dramatic.",3
14554,"A very basic overview on Data Science. You learn how to use git, rstudio, and other tools though. The other courses of the specialization are way better.",3
14559,"Extremely useful info, but the material is too shallow to be satisfying.",3
14568,"As a software engineer I found this course a bit useless, but I do understand other people don't have the same background. Having said that, I believe it should be optional in the specialization.",3
14570,"It is a good intro course to get set up with everything you may need for future courses, but it's not necessary if you are already a little familiar with github and R.",3
14577,A great course. But I still think there is a lot of room for improvement.,3
14579,Good overview. But it is confusing for the first class when you have no idea about the topic.,3
14582,"A bit odd this one. It hase some points, but most of the training is looking on what the other courses are.. Like paying for commercial :-)",3
14612,"This is a required course in the Data Science specialization. If you're planning to take that specialization, you should start with this course. If not, you shouldn't bother - there's not much here.",3
14617,"Very short, easy and introductory course. Gives a nice high altitude overview of the subject but little else.",3
14620,"Overall the course content is good, but the power points are not engaging and interactive.",3
14623,Just an intro and learning a bit about Git and Git hub.,3
14669,"It's a good preview, but very little is actually learned here.",3
14679,A little bite long regarding the concepts number developped in this course.,3
14687,An easy start ;-),3
14688,"It's ok. After the first lesson, I should be able to provide a clear elevator pitch with a high level understanding of what I can expect to accomplish (4 or 5 steps) as a Data Scientist. Instead, there was one slide that touched on this quickly, somewhere in the middle. What are the problems, how do I solve them, give samples.",3
14694,Decent for a start. Focuses too much on Github.,3
14724,I was hoping to learn more stuff I didn't already know. This class is more of just a vague overview of the other courses. Can be completed in 1 week.,3
14747,Course doesn't seem to be of much use. Was not much informative. Only some information is relevant.,3
14755,"The course is basic, and quite simple. Some might say too simple. I think it should be about 1 week long. I already knew all the things going into it so it was easy to finish it over two days.",3
14756,"Would have like to jump straight to the material. Although I understand some may need it, the command line course was pretty basic. This course on it's own doesn't give much. One can get started with Programming with R w/o missing too much.",3
14758,Could be completed in a single day but spread across 4 weeks. I could understand a week but 4 seems silly.,3
14759,Later courses are better. This one is quite easy.,3
14772,It's very straightforward.,3
14778,"Not much content for this course, can be done in a few hours.",3
14784,I think this class is best for academic people. I did not find what i was looking for.,3
14793,"Good as just an introduction to data science. Some more exercises using Github, maybe some collaborative works would have been nice.",3
14795,Good foundation for the following classes.,3
14801,"great content, a little long course for the provided content",3
14808,The instructions for using git and git hub left a lot to be desired.,3
14822,"I think this course could be integrated into the other ones of the specialization, or, if it is meant to be just a course to get an overview, be free of charge.",3
14828,"Might be a good introduction for those completely new to computational tools, but not useful for those with any background in git or R. Can be safely skipped.",3
14840,"The materials are good, but it felt like this class should have a been a 1-week introductory lesson to Data Science. It is definitely now a 4-week class, maybe a a 2-week one if you take very easy. You end up with a basic setup for the next class. That I found very useful.",3
14858,"This is a course to get you set up with all of the tools that you will need to go forward. No hard homework, but you will be ready to work. The intros into various aspects of the curriculum also serve to prepare you mentally for the coming weeks.",3
14862,"Lots of very general review information, not much new stuff. Did force me to start getting familiar with gitHub.",3
14871,Very light workload if you're technically competent. I would have liked to have had more to do with the math and such...,3
14872,A good introduction to the course. Opening up quizzes to help feedback what we'd learned (for free learners) would have made the course much better!,3
14879,The sound volume is very low,3
14890,Too simple. Personally feel this can be clubbed with R Programming,3
14900,"The course was fine, but I think it should be offered for free even if someone is doing the data science specialisation track. It is really just teaching you what data science is, and how to install a few programs.",3
14902,"It was pretty good, but most of the information is rehashed briefly in the intro to R Programming",3
14905,"The course accomplished its goal. Nevertheless, since it is a paid course I expected to find more theoretical content",3
14921,"This should be at most a 1 week course, that is free. Half the course is installing Rstudio and signing up for github. The other half of the course is simply learning what each course down the pipeline is about. Those lectures could just be tacked onto the description of each course and you would get the same thing out of it.I think this course would be improved by more instruction on what git is and how to use it and maybe going over some fundamental statistical topics.",3
14926,"A necessary prerequisite for the other Data Science classes, but not really a standalone course.",3
14927,it gives you the necessary tools and knowledge for just beginning the data mining course. so you cannot expect to learn about the process itself.,3
14933,short but good introduction,3
14937,"Only include very basic contents, doesn't need 4 weeks to finish this course. More like a one or two day induction session.",3
14947,"Basically if you take this course you are paying money to create an account on a website and download some software (both of which you can do for free). The rest of it is a preview of the other courses in the series. The quiz questions don't correspond to the information on the slides. I successfully passed the course, but I didn't really learn anything. Now I am debating on whether or not to continue to the R programming course after reading through the reviews of that course.",3
14954,It is not worth 30$,3
14960,Upgrade to submit? That's meaningless. Especially for this fundamental course.,3
14967,Doesn't provide a strong enough base for R Programming.,3
14971,"With many thanks to the instructors, I expected to learn more. I did not learn as much as a 4-week course in Coursera. Please include more materials and avoid advertising for other topics in the future courses!",3
14972,It's kind of too easy,3
14981,Probably more useful for someone with no background in programming.,3
14999,i feel i just learn the superficial knowlege,3
15007,"the lectures are full of the Prof misspeaking, this leads to you not knowing how to complete the task because the Prof can NOT communicate properly to us while we listening to the lectures... it seems like they completely missed the fact that NONE of us are data scientists...Now your Audience......",3
15019,Students be more interactive.,3
15028,Too easy,3
15032,"The overall outline are great. However, the contents and requirements of this course are too simple to be integrated as a whole course. I think 1 lecture should be enough. I am looking forward to deeper introduction.",3
15038,It's way to easy to be a separate course. It should be part of R Programming.,3
15044,"Not useful by itself, but grudgingly necessary to get you ready for subsequent courses in the specialization.",3
15046,Good but needs more assistance with the students.,3
15054,"This course is very basic for a person with an IT background, but nevertheless might come in handy for people without relevant experience.",3
15056,"This is a very basic course. If you are already a software engineer you could zoom through this entire course in an evening. If you are not a software engineer and don't know what things like github are, this class could be useful.",3
15069,"I have mixed feelings. It was WAY too easy for me, but my wife did it too and it was about right in difficulty for her. But either way, I felt like it just taught you to install stuff rather than actually teaching meaningful material.",3
15070,"Useful steps for starting the specialisation, but should this really be a course that people are paying for? Come on guys. By the way, some R programming concepts could be introduced here and de-clutter the congested/crammed R programming course.",3
15077,"Good course about getting the basics for the Data Science specialization, but a bit overpriced, as the content is low, and can easily be done in 4-5 hours.",3
15087,Very light & not really consistent with the heavy workload of subsequent courses. Felt it could have been much much stronger explaining GitHub- which shows up as a problem in latter courses strongly suggesting that toolbox does not effectively cover GitHub for newbies,3
15089,Very Basic Course. Doesn't require the time that was allotted to it.,3
15095,"Course was good, nice introduction to data science and its branches. There was not much of depth.",3
15101,Very basic if one has already worked with software before.,3
15106,Good overview of existing tools but more information will be useful to dig into the data world.,3
15110,"Very basic material, but a good introduction and a necessary step to ensure a baseline of knowledge for future courses in the data science specialization. I would only take this course if you are interested in the specialization otherwise save your money and google the info you need.",3
15117,A good beginning to a promising journey,3
15118,"Insufficient available project available for review and thus unable to pass course due to technicality. This is a major problem. The course should still be passable even in the absence of sufficient other projects to review, which is a problem that no student has any control over.",3
15123,"Too easy if you already know anything about github or Rstudio, although I do understand the need for an introductory course. The ""Experimental Design"" video was the only really useful part and contained quite entertaining examples.",3
15129,"It's a very basic introduction. Would be nice to have the option to skip it for more advanced students.Also the recorded lectures are really quite, so you have to turn up the speaker a lot.",3
15130,This course should be a free trial for whole specialisation. IT will be more helpful for students to know what is further stored in the specialisation.,3
15132,It is useful to get to know the software that staticians use and some review about them but it doesn't teach you how to use them. A good introductory course for the specialization track but useless as a unique course.,3
15140,The real basics of data analysis. The course is not bad I would just say it may be too simple even for an introductory course,3
15147,Needed a step-by-step information sheet about what R Software and Tools need to be downloaded with links.,3
15148,Thought it was too easy to be its own course :),3
15152,"It is a good course, however, I would have liked deeper knowledge in git",3
15154,Good and basic understanding of terms.Can be made vast.,3
15165,"The part of explaining Predictive and Inferential Analysis is confusing. I think it won't hurt to give some more specific examples and methods used in each case. Both types of analyses involve sampling, so I think it is necessary to keep it clear how that sample can be used to either ""infer"" or ""predict"".",3
15167,This is a good introductory course to some of the tools but it doesn't go into the details of R programming or Data Science.,3
15170,"Quite basic, but good to set the needed programs",3
15178,"I enjoyed the start up course and look forward to more, but am battling to figure out how to sign-up for the next step all roads seem to force me back to the Toolkit.",3
15206,The content is very basic. The whole course took my around 6 hours to finish. I think the instructor should add more solid training on GitHub.,3
15219,Not much helpful course,3
15228,Very common curse about common data things.,3
15236,"You don't really learn all that much, but then again I have experience with R and some data stuff already, so perhaps it'd be more useful for someone else.",3
15249,Getting started with the tools,3
15252,Learned a bit but overall it is literally not worth the price of admission. I think that this course could be offered for free and maybe the others are worth paying for. Hope that the rest of the specialization is worthwhile,3
15268,"highly recommended for newbs in any kind of development, otherwise waste of time.",3
15276,"The course was very limited, it should have been combined with Introduction to R.",3
15285,"From the basic layout of the course you would assume it's for beginners since it covers step-by-step instructions to install software and run command on command line window.But on the other hand, many advanced concepts are slipped in this course without even basic introduction. I remember in one class, ""data dredging"" is discussed for about 2-3 minutes. But the instructor did not give a brief description about what it is, instead it just goes on about when you do not have clear question in your mind, you would run the risk of data dredging.I think the course could be organized in a better way. But I do appreciate the instructors' hard work of putting up such a 10-course specialization.",3
15310,Course content good but a little too basic in my eyes. I think the addition of more functions in SAS/Python would be useful. Having to do peer reviews is also not ideal.,3
15311,"A decent start for anyone interested in learning the basics. However, please make sure you add extra efforts from your end in understanding stats concepts if you are totally new to the subject as well as browsing things related to usage of SAS or python. The course touches only the basics so it is up the learner to explore and learn more about interested statistical tool.",3
15317,"It is a good beginners course but I think there are better lessons in SAS and Python if learning these is your goal, and the content in data cleaning and visual analysis is very basic.",3
15334,"I appreciate the fact that this course doesn't go into the fine detail on how to code everything, I believe there is still more information on the coding and data management practices that could be included in the course content. In addition to that, I feel the course could use the following adjustments to make it better:1 - Have Python students grade other Python students and SAS students grade other SAS students. While it is nice to get exposure to another language, it is more than enough to learn one at a time.2 - Add quizes and/or other well formed questions that are graded (automatically, not peer graded) to help enforce the concepts being taught.3 - Make the assignment instructions/expectations more clear. I feel there are times when the grading criteria don't exactly match the requested assignment. While people follow the spirit of the assignment, the grading questions may ask for slightly different or additional items.4 - Certain aspects of statistical analysis are glossed over and should be covered in more depth in the training videos. While I like the short videos for brevity, I would prefer to watch 10-15 minutes more content and really feel like the material was well covered.",3
15346,Course material needs to updated to reflect current software updates.,3
15353,"It was good overall, some of the course materials were a bit sparse. You had to do your own research into getting packages working in spyder etc.I'd probably recommend that learners learn some python separately and read the docs for pandas.",3
15354,"Very superficial. Too few in statistics, too much in python and SAS.",3
15364,"The course has its positives, but overall does not perform well instructing on the use of the two statistical software offered (SAS & Python). At the beginning they offer multiple data sets to use and formulate a research question, but all the examples utilize only one data set and do not cover the differences you might face with the other data sets - leading to a lot of missed opportunities. Additionally, the tutorials for using the statistical software do not lend themselves towards a thorough understanding and more to a route learning.",3
15372,"The course is a very good introduction to Python for data exploration and management.That being said, it focuses too much on categorical data analysis, and I felt the transition to quantitative/continuous data was not very well done.Moreover, some more explanations about several Python functions or coding choices could be better explained.But it's encouraging to see this type of statistical course for Python and not R!! Again!",3
15377,The slides are excellent and instructions are clear and to the point. But that point is very limited. The main negative about this class is that there is absolutely no student/TA/teacher feedback and you're pretty much on your own learning.,3
15386,"They put a lot of effort into this course, but especially for the videos it was a bit too much. So many different visual backgrounds, sounds, music, text floating it... It's as if they just wanted to use everything, while never thinking about when it would start being too distracting.",3
15394,good but i thought it will cover most of SAS technology. But it has covered basics only .,3
15397,A great idea to create a project based online course. We should focus on application based learning not on lectures. You need improve this course still. 4 weeks are to short.We need more deep and more weeks.,3
15450,"Most of the courses/lectures seemed to be very basic Project Management principles. Some lectures did give a good background and high level understanding of Construction Project Management, but expected a bit more in depth info.Last lesson/assignment required more research on my part as it required general construction knowledge. The reason I took to this course was to get a better, high-level understanding of construction project management and planning, however, the Job Logic assignment expected that I would know what all is involved in the technical workings in construction (i.e. excavation, prepping, waterproofing, etc.) in which I have no experience or knowledge. A 2-hour assignment took me more than 3 hours to complete.",3
15454,Overall it's good. Depending on the customer's level of experience in construction. Some of the classes are very basic knowledge. But the structure of the course is consistent.,3
15459,I did not think the instructors were very engaging. For the most part they read from slide decks that were also on the screen. There should be more visuals and discussion about what it is like to work in construction management.,3
15471,This course offers valuable information on the different aspects of Construction Project Managment. The only critic I have is that the instructions/grading rubric for the assignments are terribly vague. The assignment starts with a simple example in the videos which the student can reasonably replicate and create their own version. The problem starts when you begin the peer-assignment grading and realize the grading points are painfully specific. Now you have to go back and re-do your homework assignment after you learned what was really expected from the student. This wouldn't be an issue except that your second draft may not get graded if all of the students are done grading. Plus it's annoying to have to re-do work that you could have done right the first time but the guidelines were unclear.,3
15495,Good start with Fundamentals. Need to take more advanced courses to gain indepth knowledge.,3
15510,"A good course with valuable insights, however, I'd like to see more assignments",3
15514,Very good audio and video quality. Explanations are very understandable and given with a lot of examples. Summaries and connections between the different content parts are provided regularly.,3
15535,"While I enjoyed this course and learned quite a bit, I think the strong leaning of the content toward use of materials for educational purposes should be made much clearer in the class title and description. Another primary complaint is that many of the quiz questions are are poorly written, requiring assumptions to be made outside of the information presented with the question. On a positive note, the wealth of supplementary content is very helpful.",3
15549,"The course is very well structured, but the teacher is boring",3
15567,I expected much deeper knowledge for the course.,3
15589,"I felt like the teaching was fairly abstract, and I had a difficult time figuring out how I was supposed to apply certain lessons. Overall, I did pick up several helpful hints, so the course was worth it.",3
15590,"I did come away with some good books/stories for reading, but would have like them to be included in the course the way it is in the Setting and Description module. I found the videos did not always lead up to the assignment, and I think the assignments could have been more clearly laid out. I still came away learning, but it did not feel very structured. To be fair, character is a sort of amorphous subject to begin with.",3
15591,"The course information was great and the assignments were very helpful. What lost points for the course was not the content provided by Wesleyan, which was good, but the poor effort on the part of many of the fellow students to really work on constructive critiques. For each assignment I had at least one of the three peer reviews that was useless to me to improve my writing, sometimes more. There should be a way to rate critiques so that students can't move on if they don't do the work of critiquing well.",3
15592,"If the week 4 was not there, i would have a 2 or even a 1 for this class.Until week 4, there was very little connection between what we were watching and what we were asked to write assignments. And the assignments were also confusing and overly restrictive. There didnt seem to be any sense in why we were asked to write those.",3
15596,"I think Judy Bloom is a brilliant writer. She is also an engaging instructor but I found it difficult at time to discern what the salient points or ""take-aways"" were from the lectures. I also found the assignment to be less than clear.",3
15601,"As much as I enjoyed completing this course, as I've enjoyed every course in this program, this one feels less organised than the others simply in that the learning material doesn't clearly connect with the writing material and it was difficult to predict what the review criteria might be. I found myself guessing at the meaning of each week's modules before completing my assignments and more often than not I discovered little correlation between the videos and assignments.",3
15607,"I found the assignment instructions to be quite confusing. Some of the questions asked for the peer-to-peer reviews were very unclear. I didn't feel the course, overall, offered the same level of content and knowledge that the Craft of Plot offered.",3
15620,This course is beneficial to all those who struggle with character plot. I thoroughly enjoyed it.,3
15628,"Excellent lectures. Assignments were a little too ""exercisey"" for me.",3
15635,"Compared to other courses in the creative writing specialization, I felt that this one needs some improvement. The video lectures just didn't have enough meat to them. For example, in other courses in the specialization, there will be links to optional readings or videos, leading to a deeper understanding of the concepts. Some readings, for example, would be welcome to give example of great (or even not so great) characterization.",3
15641,"The lectures in this class are well done and informative, and they provide a lot of good material. However, the assignment portion needs a lot of work. The instructions weren't clear for anyone taking the class which resulted in incredibly difficult grading. It was hard to even understand the basic ideas of what was required for an assignment.I think the teacher very much needs to go back and change the wording of the assignments, add more information in the instructions, and also post an example to show what is expected since a lot of the assignments are very strange, like a describing a character without mentioning the character in any way.",3
15643,"The excercises on the course are great, but the videos can be a little vague.",3
15660,"Good course, but assignment instructions were difficult to understand at times and no examples were given.",3
15668,"I've got the chance to practice writing and I've learned some interesting insights, but I think the instructor didn't put too much effort into this course. All there is to it are 'shop talks' and too little structure.",3
15742,"The course information was great and the assignments were very helpful. What lost points for the course was not the content provided by Wesleyan, which was good, but the poor effort on the part of many of the fellow students to really work on constructive critiques. For each assignment I had at least one of the three peer reviews that was useless to me to improve my writing, sometimes more. There should be a way to rate critiques so that students can't move on if they don't do the work of critiquing well.",3
15874,"if you are looking for a killer course on this topic , then this course will disappoint you .best suited for very beginner and some refresher for the older guys .",3
15905,"Not all the DSDs were useful, and some of the content is very dated (such is the nature of a MOOC that isn't maintained), but it was useful to learn about methodologies and tools to think creatively about issues and solving problems.",3
15952,"This course is okay, kind of a bit slow-paced.",3
15959,"The content was inconsistently delivered and the topics disorganized. The content was excellent, although a bit repetitive at the end.",3
15965,"The MOOC was good and full of hidden treasures. Unfortunatelly, last week had a very low quality - it was the only part I wasn't able to take out anything. Week , on the other hand, was full of interesting techniques prsented in weekly homework and surely worth further investigation. To sum up: I'm glad I finished it, but I suggest to rearrange it's form - add some videoes, and remove other ones.all the best,Piotr Milewski",3
15973,The quality of videos was pretty poor. The question and answer format of discussion was not a great idea (might have been great for kids videos). Doesn't enthuse us to continue the course. Thanks however for putting the effort and making this available to everyone for free. Really appreciate that.,3
16017,Good but many problems with platform... and help center not easy to access,3
16020,A little too basic,3
16041,"No engagement from faculty, if you have questions regarding anything in the course, no one will answer them. Unclear and incomplete instructions for assignments. Overall, probably my worst experience with Coursera.",3
16042,"Interesting, but elementary content. But absolutely no support from 'teachers'.",3
16049,So basic Tableau explanations,3
16073,"Good for what it is: a rock-bottom basic introduction. I would have appreciated more technical instruction in how to create complex, involved visualizations and less philosophizing and design ethos. A better name might have been ""What is Data Visualization? A Course In Tableau For Non-Professionals"" or something like that.",3
16078,Very basic course,3
16105,Contents are excellent.The only disappointing is that It costs to submit assignments.,3
16106,PWM Switch modelling and use of that to simplify converter modelling not covered in detail.More theoretical. Intuition on the models that we derive is not there.,3
16123,Too fast...,3
16156,Good Introduction,3
16158,"I liked it a lot but I didn't´t find helpful the assignments and how they were asked to be corrected. The assignments ask you to list things that were seen during the course but dont´t push the learner to think and look up for further information in the topic. I have also taken Business Strategy also from University of Illinois and, in my opinion, the assignments are very well conducted and the make you think and go beyond the course info.I think this is very important to address it properly because it is when the learner really acquire the knowledge, when he/she has to connect what he/she has learnt with real cases.",3
16160,"Needs to structured a bit better.Answers to discussions if provided will be very helpful and help analyse situations in the way instructor aims to.The MIT Case readings, not 10min things, thos cases are all like 20 pages+!",3
16170,Nice but only for those who search their first job.,3
16228,"I found some of the topics repetitive and trivial, already covered in previous courses of the specialization. However, there was good advice that still makes it a worthwhile course.",3
16236,It seemed to me that it is a good introduction for someone totally new to the topic.,3
16269,"Informative and well presented, but honestly you need to make the core readings available online, as it makes it really difficult to possibly get the most out of this course. I live in a remote part of Australia where are no universities or public libraries which would have a copy of the book by Calhoun, and even if I had been able to afford the book it would have taken 6 weeks or more to get to me. So I read the alternative readings but it clearly wasn't enough to get the quiz questions right which were obviously extracted directly from content of the Calhoun book. If it isn't possible to make sections of this book available online then you should at least rewrite some of the quiz questions so that they are accessible to students who can't get hold of a copy of the book.",3
16277,"Course have nice subject, but somehow cannot take my full attention all the time. Missing more practical examples.",3
16365,Had important problems with SAS which were due to a bug in the software but did not receive any help from moderators. However the course was good and interesting.,3
16368,Interesting but very superficial I would say.,3
16385,There was no explanation about background mathematics. Grading metrics are unclear because assessment of assignments are only peer grading.,3
16386,Very basic introduction and not thorough or mathematical enough.,3
16387,"There is a lot of self-teaching with these courses because there are no professors present to reach out to with questions. In addition, the course staff do not always respond promptly nor are they fully knowledgeable about all aspects of error messages that may arise out of coding. At times the code that were provided in the lecture videos were out of date and a lot of time was spent on googling to find the updated code. This is definitely not a beginner coder course and I do not recommend it to anyone who has not coded before.",3
16415,"The course has intrinsic value, but as the complexity of the materials covered, the weekly slides were a priority to allow students to grasp better the materials covered. Just relying in the videos to assimilate the content is not an effective form of learning. Also pausing the videos to watch the definitions in most cases was ineffective as it was hard to see it properly. Please consider to release the lecture slides to all courses. If the slides were available, that would helped me to go further in my learning proccess. That's why I only give a 3/5. The slides are determinant to improve and master (to some extent) the materials covered.",3
16516,"The course is clear and goes at a sustained but correct pace. I really like the fact to show the weakness to understand what are the requirements of a secure PRF, PRP & co!Optional programming assignments are really interesting unfortunately they take too much time to do and lack of guidance as it could be the case for the famous ML course. At least the first exercises should provide a development environment to get familiar with: hex, crypto libs, dictionary research, stats algorithms implementation ...The first two weeks lack of in-video tests.",3
16570,"Generally, a fair intro to key topics in ""Cybersecurity and Mobility"", however some of the sources are dated (and could be updated), given the fast-paced nature of the field. Still, worth some time if you want to learn more about where current trends are heading.",3
16574,"A little dated, with most material and research presented from the glorious days of 2012. The issues at hand are however still valid, though",3
16596,"This course provided some god information on version control and file naming conventions, but a lot of the lessons just refer to the DDI protocol.",3
16603,This is a an important topic and more scientists (and students in the sciences) should learn about this but the quizzes are not great as a learning aid and my motivation is running through lows.,3
16622,Personally they should add a free textbook and a vocabulary list with clear examples.So yes this course could benefit from more detail time to time,3
16645,A free book to read would have been nice.,3
16654,The material is fine but the course isn't taught well. The instructor tends to start talking immediately in subject jargon and abbreviations without first giving students an intro or explaining foundation material first. It seems a lot of material is left out of the lectures and slides on purpose and forces students to buy the instructor recommended text book (which is also authored by the instructor). After each lecture I'm forced to Google search a lot of what was mentioned before I even understood half of what the instructor was talking about. I didn't pay to listen to something that forces me to Google search everything.,3
16659,Peer Review is sub-optimal,3
16662,This course is really helpful About Database Systems.,3
16666,"Great content, horrible technical support from Coursera and the team that runs this program (since it is clearly obvious that Michael Mannino just recorded the videos and is not part of the class anymore).",3
16676,"Nice introductory course for database management. Assignments are challenging enough for beginners like me but I like that. If I'm already 'investing' my time into something I expect to learn something in return. This course gave me that kind of reciprocity. Course would benefit from radically different approach to video-lessons. Reading from power-point slides which are written in the same manner, have identical structure tends to become tedious after a while. Professor seems nice and knowledgeable but a bit more relaxed and/or engaging approach would be beneficial to many. Oh, and peer-reviewed grading, wherever possible, should be replaced with an auto-grader. That's not a critique, though. Not quite sure if it's even possible with this kind of material.",3
16684,"The course was clear, I had difficulties to find course materials, especially examples were used in the video class, I wish they had been put in more obvious places.",3
16696,"Do not be fooled by the course description. You do need to know some basics before attempting the course. Be prepared to look a lot of things up independently or purchase the ""optional"" text book. There is virtually no moderator in this course and the instructor does not grade or comment on the discussions. Basically he is reading you PowerPoint slides and adding very little to the lesson by watching and listening to him do so. Your grades are based on what your peers (who are also trying to learn) think or interpret the correct answer to be based on their limited knowledge and discretion. I would not recommend this course for someone wishing to learn SQL as it is not the main focus, it is only a small part of the lessons.",3
16700,"Pros: Information is perfect for anyone looking at Business Intelligence as a career field, or already in the career field itself. I found the first week to challenge my on-the-job knowledge of a fuller set of concepts and general terminology.Cons: The wording on the quiz questions, in some cases, seems much different than the PPT slides and the instructor's language. UPDATE: The wording is a significant challenge, even when advancing into the more complex topics. I have had many differences of opinions on the solutions based on wording in the requirements.",3
16702,"The specialization is great, and the course breadth and topics described in each is equally good. For this course, however, I felt like I could have covered what was taught by myself with a book, i.e. I didn't feel like it was class room level engaging with the explanations.I realized this is a one way MOOC, but I've taken courses off and on since they came out, and some others felt more interactive. This was more of here's a slide, I will read what's on the slide and explain some topics. The assignments were not bad, but definitely took more time than stated (just keep that in mind). The other thing that would help immensely is having TAs in the course. It's possible that they may get some later, but I've felt I learned/got feedback a lot more in courses with TAs.That said, this is an excellent introduction to databases course, and there's not many of them out there. If I had to go it again, I would, and I also paid for getting the cert - if anything for career advancement and having it on your LinkedIn profile as a starter DB course.",3
16719,"Pros: The course content covers a lot of relevant topics on Database Management. Things like Basic SQL queries, Database Normalization, Conceptual and Logical databases, and making ER diagrams are covered in the course.Cons: Prof Mannino is a bit robotic in his reading out of long sentences and the constant pace of talking. There is tons of repetition of sentences and words mere seconds after they were just spoken. The lectures seem to be a collection of bullet points.The assignments and the peer review structure is really a low point. There's no specific grading rubric - so points allocation is random and based on your peer's assessment. I had many instances where my right answers were marked as wrong. There is nothing you can do to correct it. Moreover, the questions are iterative and thus the same apparent error carries on and you get multiple wrong scores.Assignments need to be submitted in documents. Separate documents for each question !! At times, even a one-line answer needs to be in a separate document. Pictures of database diagrams need to be pasted in said documents. It was a bit frustrating to take screenshots all the time. Especially when you make a small correction, and have to take screenshots AGAIN, then paste it AGAIN, and upload AGAIN !!Summary: Take the course for it's content, and use the assignments as good practice. Don't take the grading seriously. Also, focus on the content rather than the delivery by the professor, and you will still be able to get some value out of the course (and the specialization by extension)",3
16725,"I found the content was great but the style of lectures were a bit too robotic and not conversational. This didn't help the learning process. Also, the course admin might consider explaining 'On' 'And' 'Where' 'TIMESTAMP', 'DateDiff' more than what was provided.",3
16746,"Interesting, I would have liked to deepen SQL knowledge and practice. The conceptual parti seems a little bit too important.",3
16763,I wish to have more contact with the academic crew.,3
16795,"It's Ok, nothing much to gain iin terms of knowledge realted to cyber conflict.",3
16799,"I like the comparisons between past physical wars and current cyberwar. However, the course take the long way to explain very basic elements of nations interactions and trust.",3
16800,"The videos were not always easy to understand because of the unclear pronouncing of the key speaker. Also although most of the tests were easy to complete, the ones that you had to write the answer down instead of only choosing the correct answer, were hard since if one word you wrote was wrong you lost the question.",3
16832,Wished the course was a deeper dive into this area.,3
16849,"On the positive side I emphasise the importance of bringing this topic to a Coursera course. Also the readings were important and added value to the learning experience.On the other hand there are - in my opinion some aspects that made this course a not so rich experience. First, there are some audio issues in the videos. Second, the quizzes are excessively easy and the in video quizzes should not appear in the weekly assignments. If there are required readings, some of the quiz questions should relate to those readings. This way students had an incentive to go over those readings. But the most salient thing that made my experience very limited was the fact that one of the instructors - the one that presented most of the videos, was excessively nervous and all that he did was read the slides, in most cases not doing so naturally and committing errors, rephrasing, stopping, changing speed. I found it very, very difficult to follow along what he was saying. I had to focus only on the slides, otherwise I would get distracted. I think it is ok to be nervous or at ease, but the team should alerted him to this, and shoot the videos again and again until they had acceptable and balanced quality.A minor thing, I would like to had available the weekly slides to further reflection. I think the video issues that I've mentioned should been carefully planned before this course made it mainstream.This is my opinion. Hope it will help you for future improvements of the course and/or other offerings.Ricardo Oliveira",3
16869,"Interesting to try R hands on. Could have made more definitive statements on the usefulness of each test (there was lots of 'you could have a look at this analysis, or this one, or this one' without covering why each one would be particularly good for this case). Some of the later exercises also made quite of a leap in terms of what you were expected to know about R syntax, although the follow up answers were good if you didn't understand what was expected.",3
16875,"This module took me on an interesting journey with lots of twists and turns. While I love challenges and learning otherwise I wouldn't have taken this course. I'd like to suggest the following: mentor to assist students, review of codes I found lots of glitches, one quiz rather than two, cut back on timeframe. I'd like to give more stars but am being generous with 3 stars.",3
16898,Quite advanced in contrast to the rest of this specialization!,3
16901,"Not finding it very useful, but it's good to know about the concepts and theories for each type of experiments.",3
16904,"I was able to follow the course and keep the pace but I got lost on factorial ANOVA. The professor is great but the course feels rushed through. It would be great if more time was spent on actual explanation of main concepts, since many here are the beginners in stats. I will try again, hopefully will get it this time.",3
16908,"I think the course requires some basic statistic knowledge which I do not know anything about, it is tough to keep out. If providing some basic reading or keynote before hand would be really helpful!",3
16938,"Interesting case studies, but very uninteresting professor.",3
16943,"The course was interesting, but unfortunately it really felt like it was tailored to a male audience. The metaphors, examples (ie ""surely you've taken part in team sports like American Football"") and tone really made it feel like the course was aimed not at me, but at men. As a woman in an industry dominated by men, this was disappointing because I don't believe that I am any less deserving of a place at the top table, but this course made me feel like those kind of jobs weren't for me. I would prefer it if the course leaders would take the time to look at the content of this and other iMBA courses and ensure that the content takes on a more neutral tone, to make it feel more welcoming to people traditionally shut out of very senior roles",3
16945,"very useful content, great readings, but total lack of peer-to-peer engagement. It's like reading a book: nice but not up to industry best practices. Overall, the course is lower quality than the ones before from Gregory Northcraft. Another problem with this specific course is word hunting in quizzes. The ones for case studies are especially tricky.",3
16946,OK course. Difficult to follow at times. The assignments and reading make it worth taking.,3
16948,Just taking part of the course material was rewarding. A good basic introduction to Organization Design. Looking forward to the next step in Designing the Organization,3
16949,The course lacks coherence which comes as a big disappointment as it follows two excellent modules by Greg Northcraft.,3
16976,This course was a let down. There wasn't enough practical or real world examples to practice with. Good candidates would have been software companies in the SaaS space.,3
16978,"hands on experience based content would have been appreciated, Its a good course.",3
16980,"the information is outdated, and I have find some examples, services not working anymore. during the course.",3
16982,Good course for basic information about digital analytics.,3
16983,I wished the content and the tests were more challenge.,3
17003,"The content is definitely interesting. But I didn't see any ""Practice"" there... I didn't really get the difference theory vs practice between this course and the previous one ""Digital Analytics for Marketing Professionals: Marketing Analytics in Theory"".Sometimes the assignments were not very interesting, and didn't always help practicing the content exposed in the lectures... For example, the piece about the different statistical tools: I didn't get why it was included in the course... either we do exercises on it, or it shouldn't be in the course... but there is not point of knowing by heart the differences between the different statistical tools.The part about the customer decision journey, the plan for analytics, and the different analysis techniques were very interesting. I would have liked to see and practice more concretely how to collect data (e.g. how to perform clickstream analysis), etc.And the lectures should avoid general tips and guidelines (like ""5 things to avoid in order to""... the web is full of this kind of content)... I mean, it has to be ""in Practice"". And the professor should know exactly the content of his slides, and prepare his speech.Lastly, a lot of the suggested readings were from a blog that is really horrible to read... The author of the blog might be very knowledgeable on his subject, but his blog it is full of useless jokes, very long to read... I mean one of its articles could 3 times shorter if he gets straight to the point",3
17004,"This is very much a primer. I was hoping it would go into more detail than it did, but I did find it a very helpful overview.",3
17013,nice but doesnt give you much knowledge,3
17014,"Presents a useful analysis framework, but with limited practical examples to learn how to use analytical tools.",3
17040,"Even though the theoretical part was well put together, case study questions were too vague and should have been better thought out. This part of the specialization did not meet my expectation.",3
17043,not enough practical examples. the information is providede on a bit higher level,3
17049,I expected it to be far more,3
17061,Not practical enough,3
17066,I would have appreciated practicing more,3
17067,"I was somewhat disappointed in this course as I expected much more ""practice"". The assignments did not have you actually perform any analytics activities. The course materials seem very out of date considering how much things change in the digital age. Reading Blogger posts from 2006 on a Blogger blog that hasn't been updated since 2012 is not forward thinking in my view. Yes, things don't always change, but the face of analytics changes daily.",3
17069,The course is very informative for those interested in data analytic and want to go for market research kind of jobs.,3
17084,Same as the theory class not much examples or case studies....,3
17092,Good High Level understanding of Analytics,3
17096,Marketing Analytics in theory was much more enriching than this one. It would be great if tutors can add practical examples to show how marketing analytics is actually performed it would have been great.,3
17100,A little too simple and too broad. Overall it's ok.,3
17106,Interesting but not much practice despite the title.,3
17119,It was too easy for me.,3
17141,"I know a lot of work went into preparing this material. Although the Table of Contents serves this purpose in a more text-rich, visually complicated way - something I would find very useful is a step by step table or guide (to ensure no step is skipped) for the entire process, i.e.Requirement ActivitiesUse CasesWireframesStory Board developmentUser Story DevelopmentProduct Backlog Developmentand so on. I hope this will be helpful.",3
17251,Too high level course. Expected more from it.,3
17272,"Overall I enjoyed this course and got a broad overview of the various technologies used in big data analysis. The course is video heavy but short on practice. There are 3 assignments the first 3 weeks, then week4 is an endless series of videos. I really enjoyed the assignments but felt there should have been more assessment/practice provided -there are no quizzes to reinforce understanding. The readings provided are mostly academic ones which aren't that clear to beginners (even to programmers like me).In contrast, a Python data science course on another MOOC platform has 4 times as much content with practice exercises after every video, mid and final exams, weekly problem sets as well as readings.Ultimately the course showed me what I need to learn next to get into Data Science but the first course hasn't given me confidence that the rest of the specialization will be worth the money.",3
17282,Good content for Data Scientists but video lessons are not sufficient to be able to complete the assignments. It required great deal of own searching and trials and errors to complete the course.,3
17290,"The lectures are all just the right length. As a working professional, it was easy to consume the course in my varying bits of free time. For the most part, the assignments were good. There were a few places where there were mistakes in the instructions or the code downloaded from github had some errors. It was fairly clear that these mistakes have been around for quite sometime, so I wonder why nobody ever bothered to update the code in github or update the bad instructions. This is the internet, not a published textbook. That should be pretty easy to fix. It was also a little disappointing that the 4th lesson was extra long in terms of lectures and had no related assignments. The course was marked as completed when I finished the 3rd assignment so the fourth lesson was effectively optional.",3
17299,Found the assignments were 'very loosely' aligned with the lecture material and had poorly formed problems in places.Lectures were reasonably good but not quite up to the standard set with other U of W Data Science courses or other University Data Science / Machine Learning courses I have taken.,3
17305,"Long, slow, rambling video. I watched most of it at 1.75x. Slides are kind of a mess and lectures are disorganized.",3
17330,Assignments were just not that challenging except first one,3
17332,"This course has appealing assignments and covers interesting topics. The course, however, has two fatal flaws. First, the lectures are a bit disjointed. While there is much to learn in the lectures, the lecturers style is a bit halting and scattered (it would have been much better presented if the lecturer had a script to read off of.) As is, the lectures are mediocre, which is unfortunate since the lecturer is clearly knowledgeable about the topics presented.Second, the assignments suffer from a lack of good error messaging and no support in the forums (aside from what you will find from other students, which can be very helpful at times.) The assignments themselves are a great approach to learning concepts (and you get to work with real data, like the Twitter data), but without good error messaging when you submit a script you pretty much end guessing where you are taking a wrong turn.I had high hopes for this course, but it seems as though it fails on execution.",3
17335,"Somehow interesting course about Data analysis. The lectures are interesting for those who have no prior knowledge about the topics, but boring to those who have it. The assignments are quite challenging and the disadvantage is, that they are not connected to the lectures and are therefore not well explained. What I like about the assignments is, that it is practical.",3
17338,"The emphasis on methods rather than specific tools makes the course more resistant to the continuous changes in technology. The stage is set well, and there are practical implementations. Still, it's disappointing to see that errors from previous rounds have not been corrected.",3
17347,It was really frustrating that the autograder and assignment instructions didn't match. This course has been around too long for that big of a mistake. The lectures were the redeeming factor. They were interesting and presented the subject matter in a concise way.,3
17353,"Lots of good material, though I don't like how they've repackaged the original material from the prior longer version, which I worked through at my own pace a year ago, off session. Cramming all the material relating to NoSQL and Graph Analytics into the final week without assignment is ineffective. Instead, consider focusing the 4th week on NoSQL, and keep an assignment with it, maybe even the original Pig assignment that required and AWS account. I don't think the nominal charge Amazon will levy would hold anybody up who's serious about learning to process data at scale, it's just a few bucks.",3
17354,"the material is too simple. This course is just like a brief introduction, but not a course in college to teach student the real knowledge. I think MOOC course should be the same as a real college course. With the same difficulty and amount of material.",3
17361,"This is a cooked up version from an earlier, more extensive course. Lecture videos now split from 10-14 minutes into lots of 4-6 minute videos. It seems, some assignments are missing, too.",3
17362,Program instructions could be more specific. Make it clear exactly what format the programs output should be.,3
17383,"I consider the assignment is not very useful. Network plot usually does not help much if you are researching dataset. Scatterplot, histogram can be much useful. Tableau? Sorry, can't afford it, why not excel? At least, almost anyone uses it. Not very practical one, but it does contains a lot of information in the course.",3
17385,"I chose the ""Data Mining"" specialization to learn more about data mining ;-)I'm not so interested to present data",3
17391,"The course is awsome to get motivation and quite informative. However it teaches lot of practical concepts using Tableau which is a commercial software.Since these concepts entirely new to me. It take me a lot of time to understand videos and still I'm afraid I'll forget the things as soon as I leave it. I think some more practical activities should be introduce (on free platforms), to make knowledge more sustainable.",3
17398,It's not necessary for me,3
17402,"I thought at times the explanations were a bit concise. If I look at the process mining course for example, a lot more video material is included (and its price is lower) with more concrete examples and practice. For non programmers it is not evident to find a solution to some of the assignments and there isn't much guidance on how to use certain tools. therefore, the time to be invested for non programmers - especially in week 3 - is far more than the hou",3
17431,"The same as I have written for the other courses in the specialty. The course information was great and the assignments were very helpful. What lost points for the course was not the content provided by Wesleyan, which was good, but the poor effort on the part of many of the fellow students to really work on constructive critiques. For each assignment I had at least one of the three peer reviews that was useless to me to improve my writing, sometimes more. There should be a way to rate critiques so that students can't move on if they don't do the work of critiquing well.",3
17435,"Just as the Amy Bloom's course, this course has no descriptive arch and one is left to try and grasp the teaching points in a flood of reference material. Teach theory in a clear structure first please then provide reference. See Brando Skyhorse course, very structured.",3
17488,"If you've not read a single book on writing, this class might be good. Otherwise, don't expect to get much about the ~30 minutes of lecture.",3
17503,I would strongly recommend the instructor provide pdf lecture notes that we could save please.,3
17511,"Geared specifically to college professors, as opposed to general public. Could be more useful with more background information on ADA and IDEA and everyday implications. Could also incorporate mental illness and disability aspects.",3
17520,"Great, but easy",3
17539,"Good intro to the terms, concepts, and approach for data science.",3
17552,The course can use more visuals instead of videos of the face of the instructor. It can also use more interactive examples as this is a more executive view instead of having scholar examples.,3
17557,A little too high-level for what I was looking for but a good introduction to get familiarized with some of the terminology and concepts.,3
17574,"The first week gave me a good insight into the data science process. I now understand the situations in which Data Science can best be applied. However, I still do not fully understand the statistics aspect. It would help me if the instructors would provide examples in detail of supervised vs unsupervised learning. I seem to understand the theory behind it but I am not sure how valuable it will be for me.",3
17584,"Brian Caffo's lectures were rambling and confusing, with excessive use of jargon without proper explanation. His graphs were overwhelming with information, and little effort was made to explain the graph. Otherwise, the other lectures were very good, concise, and clear. Thank you.",3
17602,A good introduction to data science.,3
17606,needed more depth,3
17611,Good overview... but expected more content..,3
17618,Nice overview for those of us unschooled in the language. Syntax of the notes and text is in need of major editing-proofreading.,3
17627,Would have been better if quiz access is available for free so that it is easier to reinforce concepts learnt.,3
17641,Good introductory course but a bit too superficial.,3
17653,Very basic course!,3
17662,"This course leaves you frustrated, as valuable information is only ad the end and at the beginning. It doesn't really answer questions of what are data science, big data, machine learning, how they interact and how to use them.",3
17663,Excersices! real excersices to really understand the theory.,3
17713,"Was expecting more of the how to's and a bit of programming or at least concepts of the programming/statistics, but I guess there are different interpretations of the idea of a crash course.Definitely geared for people who work with data scientists but not in the data science field.",3
17716,Too basic.,3
17721,Interesting but uneven. Felt like the first draft of a team-taught course,3
17727,Really basic course. Not needed for people you have already done data science specialization in coursera,3
17739,"I want to give 3.5 stars but there is only option for 3 or 4.Given that it's geared more towards wanna be managers in this field. I would have expected lot of case studies, and links to additional material for individual reading plus a mini write up or a project at the end.For MOOCs to compete with a degree program or an onsite instruction few of the things I think that are needed areInterviews with industry practitioners which is a big plus.interviews/postings from people with similar background as the 90% of the MOOC students of this program who made it... this motivates the students from dropping from the middle of the course/specilization programslinks to additional articles that the students can read at leisurewriteup/project as assignments that the students can pursue and publish (not necessarily for grade but as a mind jogger)One more thing that I think should help (not specific to this course) is that the student with the best grade should be offered one free course and think this will motivate the students to complete the courses.",3
17741,Great course for somebody who does not know anything about data science. When doing this specialisation there should be credit for those that did the other data science specialisation,3
17744,Lectures were fairly straightforward but not really that exciting and the lecturers sometimes felt a little unprepared or underwhelming.,3
17756,"Very basic level, nice talks though",3
17761,Solid introduction. Not so engaging if using the non-paid options,3
17770,"Good, simple, straightforward, and applied. It starts to introduce you to the language and platforms of data science, but it is most definitely not a standalone course if you want to be conversant in the field. Really just a ""taster"" to get you into the specialization.",3
17782,Interesting course,3
17788,"I wanted to like this course but It felt entirely too academic in terms of both the subject matter and the way the specifics of ""data science"" are presented. The course content reminded me of my time a few years ago when I was enrolled in a Ph.D. program at a major Tier 1 research university. The professors were great, but the content was esoteric and incredibly focused on research based ""data science"" and less on business analytics or more practical applications of data science for the working professional. I felt myself re-watching the videos to try and understand the content because there were many instances where the professors' spoke about some fundamental aspect of data science but failed to provide some real world context. I liked the course but I would not recommend it as a crash course for the working professional, more like a crash course for someone who already has a degree in statistics/math/engineering who is looking to further their studies in an academic setting where research is the main goal.",3
17789,"The courses in this specialization are - in my opinion, excessively short.",3
17814,Concise but could already include a basic proyect.,3
17818,"Good course, with general and not over-detailed explanations of all the relevant topics in data Science. A good, general overview definitively worth working on.",3
17830,Simple and good overview of Data Science,3
17840,"Very basic course. If you know about data science, data analysis, or machine learning, you may find this class basic or boring. Good intro course for those who have no prior knowledge",3
17852,"It provides a quich shot on data science, but the way it presents is not so interesting.",3
17856,"A good introductory overview of data science. Grounds you on what you can & cannot do with data science. I find defining the question really impactful. Teachers were enthusiastic and the brevity of the course gives it good appeal for beginners who want to ""get their feet wet"".",3
17872,"There were some good modules in this course and the assignments were helpful in applying the principles. The videos were not as polished as those in the previous courses. It gave the feel of the course a bit of ""quick to market"" feel, particularly given that it was a week late in getting started.Overall though, I would recommend it.",3
17873,Week 1 & 2 not terribly useful; week 3 (in depth look at actions within dashboards) & 4 (significant content relating to building a story) are what I expected the class/series to be.,3
17904,"The main reason for my rating is because the course is so ""loose"" on what your are supposed to achieve incrementally every week that it can lead to some hard situations.Just to give my example: the first week was piece of cake and I didn't feel like it really contribute for the following weeks. Then, I was struggling with the suggested library (tm) until I got support through the discussion forums and someone suggested me to use quanteda.Then thinks started to run smoothly, or so I thought. When implementing the language model (which, at first, I thought was supposed to be KBO), I got stuck for a long period. Not because my model was wrong (I was able to implement it and to check it against some hand-written and proved examples - which I should probably thank again), but because I was not able to make it run efficiently enough for the given constraints.Being stuck in this stage for longer than I wanted, I had to sacrifice another important steps of data analysis pipeline in order to not jeopardize my final delivery by not meeting the final due date. I know that this is exactly what will happen in the ""real"" life, but I think that some better guidance could guarantee the students spent a more even amount of time in across all steps.All things considered, I think the Capstone was really interesting and likely took more than the 4-9 hours per week, but most of this is probably because of the problems I faced.I believe that with a better guidance on the paths to follow or maybe some suggested libraries to use, a lot of ""noise"" (useless difficulty) could be removed and this course would definitely get more starts.",3
17914,"It's been a challenge to learn all these new concepts and package them into a working product in such a small period of time. I am glad of the things I learned. Also, in my opinion the materials / resources given to this course are scarce compared with previous courses of the specialization.",3
17916,it could've given more instructions!,3
17936,"This was essentially a self-study project with some social peers. The topic, approach, and standards were different from all of the other units in the Data Science specialization. I found the other units more enjoyable.Learning the essentials of NLP quickly is necessary to begin the project. I ordered a textbook, for example, and I was fortunate that it arrived quickly. If NLP is a prerequisite for this capstone project - whether in the form of a prior class or textbook knowledge - this should be indicated clearly on the course description page.Nevertheless, the main learning that I achieved with this course was in the area of software engineering - specifically, how to take advantage of vectorization in R to achieve reasonable computing performance. While this is a valuable skill, it doesn't seem the proper focus of a capstone course in a sequence focused primarily on other topics.As noted elsewhere in these comments, there was a complete absence of any traditional teaching support. Learning outcomes suffered as result. The missing resources included instructors, mentors, partners, and learning materials.The course site notes an expected time requirement of a few hours per week. My commitment was 20 hours per week, under some pressure. Numerous students take this ""course"" multiple time, in order to arrange for reasonable software development time.Producing working software was fun, as it always is. The course learner community was supportive, which is fortunately typical for Coursera.All in all, this project was *not* an effective capstone for the Data Science specialization. The project was interesting in its way, but it felt 'parachuted in' to this learning sequence.",3
17938,"As a capstone to a series of courses that covered data science and R, I found this one to be a bit lacking. There was no involvement from the professors at JHU or the folks at SwiftKey. As was mentioned in another review, the course feels abandoned. All you get a few short (two minutes or so) videos that give you little in the way of instruction or direction. Basically, they just say, ""Go do this. Good luck!""There were also no Mentors or TAs to guide students or answer questions. It was the students helping each other through the forums. Sometimes it was helpful and everyone involved learned something. Other times, it was the blind trying to lead the visually-impaired.On a positive note, you will use all of the skills from the previous courses: writing R functions, performing exploratory analysis and publishing it via RPubs. Your final product will be displayed for everyone via ShinyApps and a presentation using R Presentation (also published via RPubs).On a(nother) negative note, the topic of Natural Language Processing is not an easy one to just walk into and feel confident in providing a working next-word prediction algorithm in about eight (8) weeks. You're reading academic journal articles, watching multiple videos from another Coursera course (which actually focuses on the topic of NLP, and takes place over several courses and several months!).Supposedly, there is work going on to update the course, so hopefully future students will get a better experience. I did take a bit away from this course, especially since I made more than one attempt to complete it. However, it was definitely a shock to find myself missing those things that one typically finds in a learning environment -- descriptive background, assistance to problems, etc. -- and seeing that I was for all intents and purposes on my own. Even in the professional world of data analysis, I have never experienced the lack of support that I found in this course.With that, I am giving it three (3) stars. As I said, I did learn a bit, but it was a bit of a struggle that required multiple attempts to complete. This would have been better off as a stand alone topic (which it already is by another Coursera affiliated school), or having a capstone course that builds on a topic more in the wheelhouse of the JHU professors: a capstone project focusing on bioinformatics or biostatistics would have been amazing in comparison to this.",3
17939,"Hi, the prject was nice and at the end I learned some new things, but it didn't have people to provide any guide. In the videos it was said that personal from SwiftKey will be there as well as JHU teachers could provide some insights. It looked a bit like a phantom course",3
17949,I liked every course in this specialization except,3
17961,Most stressful but interesting. Not enough material was provided,3
17962,"Could be better. The teacher sometimes explain the concepts in a hard way, and not always shows how to do in practice.But you will get curious and in case of doubts, you can find more simple explanations on the web, and the forum is very good.The assignments are hard, you will need do research to accomplish then, but is the best way to learn.I think the specialization is good to someone without much knowledge on the field (like me). But it's only the start!",3
17995,"I'd review this course for two parts: lectures and programming assignments.Lectures: Prof. Jiawei Han is a pioneer of the subject. However, I was expecting a more indepth elaboration of techniques. In almost all his lectures he covered very crucial topics at a near-shallow level. For someone like me, it was a motivation to be learning the subject from him but I was left disappointed a little bit. I felt if i was just to gain a superficial understanding then I would have browsed through any website/blog/article rather than paying for this course and coming here under his tutelage. I will not expect him to be as thorough as he'd be in his lectures at UIUC (although why not!) but a more elaborative explanation with more notable examples (instead of pointing to the reading material at the end of 4th minute of the lecture) will be more fruitful and a better learning experience.The programming assignments are challenging and will definitely open up the thought process towards being able to imagine what patterns mean and how to go about extracting them.",3
18008,"The content was interesting, but it was too much theory, sometimes a bit borring",3
18013,There should have been more examples and more use case and more applied rather than just a theoretical discussion,3
18014,Highly recommended .Wonderful course and good content but a bit slow ..Could have been faster.,3
18015,Not enough depth.,3
18023,"This course is ok, but it gives only high level overview of cloud technologies. I will do the second part, but I will do a free version. I don't think that it's worse this money.",3
18025,"Wish there will be some lab assignments, for example doing some real work on AWS.",3
18026,Consider adding a programming assignment to the course curriculum. Please address content issues in a timely manner. Thank you.,3
18072,"its very basic stuff , and uses not optimal solutions to coding challenges , which might be okay for basics , for example the spelling check/suggestion project algorithm is probably exponential in time complexity .",3
18107,"The course does an OK (but not great) job at teaching Data Structures. And it does an OK (but not great) job at teaching Algorithm Performance/Optimization.The lectures and starter code could use some better integration.The assignments could be improved. They give you a bunch of code and ask you to complete it. This is kinda the way things work when you inherit a bunch of code, but its not how it works if you have to write it from scratch.This course has been taught many times, and the forums contained old posts, and they didn't seem as useful as in other courses I've taken.My main objective for this course was to continue learning Java, and it helped me do that, so I gave it 3 Stars.",3
18134,"Introductory course to data structures. The lectures are good, however the assignments are too much guided. Sometimes you can get it done without actually understanding what is going on.",3

18214,Not difficult course but teaches you much about Java,3
18225,HW is a bit boring,3
18231,The instruction is vague and boring.,3
18259,Good introduction to very basic stuff. I skipped many videos and found the same information on the internet. If it wasn't part of the specialization I wouldn't pick it.,3
18296,Can be mprovised in terms of course content,3
18302,"student needs to read a lot out of this course in order to solve the exercises!the course materials are not enough, and they focus more on images, while this entire course for beginners level, it should be fundamental stuff.overall the course is good but needs more changes",3
18356,Moderator answer in a very short time. I was impressed of that. I think the course should add a video to explain more in details some concept as variables. many of my issues were coming from deep doubts i had about this. maybe explain variables on hardware and variables as pointers.,3
18388,"For the eager student maybe some more resources should have been shared. I was hoping to learn some production quality environment basics e.g. the ideal editor, best practices etc.That said- I really liked how the 3 components, css, js and html were stitched together to help understand interactive webpages using js.",3

18440,Cannot participate in graded work unless purchased.,3
18450,"Material is relevant. Most of the assignments require student guesswork, writing functions not covered in the lecture.",3
18451,"This course is very difficult. I recommend only taking it if you have some experience with syntax. Although very challenging, I learned a ton.",3
18487,"HTML and CSS were well explained and clearly cover. However, some of the JavaScript was glossed over and very difficult to follow.",3
18488,"The course is well put together, however they say you do not need any programming background, but you definitely need a little. I had to use other sources to help such as Codeacademy and Udemy just to keep up. The do not go over loops, conditionals or basic C foundation that would help. The leap from HTML, CSS to JavaScript is massive. They need to relook some of the topics and either more videos or add in some easier teaching methods. I took a similar one on Udemy (that was free) just after I completed this one and it was 10x easier to understand and closed so many loops I had when learning JavaScript.",3
18496,"I will give it a 3* review as I really enjoyed and learned a lot in the HTML and CSS part (first 2 weeks), but the java script is really poorly covered. It is too hard and with no ""translations"" on what the hell is going on. The Duke University team is good and they obviously know what they are doing, but they need to review this course and make it more simpler... :)",3
18498,"I learned a lot. Still, I wish the explanation were more geared toward beginners.",3
18499,"This course is fine, but by week 3 and 4, it is already getting very advanced. It is quite impossible to finish within 4 weeks",3
18500,"Although you might learn something, this course is not well organized. I wouldn't recommend it.",3
18501,javascript part is not covered in depth,3
18506,"It is a good course, but I'm not sure it's simple enough for beginners - it doesn't teach you all the steps you need to know",3
18508,"Lessons are too compact and some of the videos too long and full of content, so it's hard to process all the information at once.",3
18515,HTML/CSS - easyJS - extremely hard,3
18516,Hard to understand JS part.,3
18519,"Good overall but the content uses library and other content that make it hard to apply the technologies to the real world, an emphasis on orienting the content to 'from scratch development' would be duly appreciated I think. Nevertheless interesting and well presented over all.",3
18526,"Though it is a nice introduction, I would have expect a more syntax learning lessons.",3
18527,Took this as part of a Java specialization but would not have taken it otherwise.,3
18531,It's ok...,3
18535,"This course was okay at best. The last two weeks focused too much on image functions and making. While I get that this can be a 'fun and practical' example, it became stale and annoying. It was more stressful than anything else. I really hope the future classes in the Specialization aren't designed in the same way. Variety is not a bad thing.",3
18550,"The first two weeks the course present a reasonable pace for beginners. The second two weeks, when the Java Script is introduced, the projects suddenly become very hard. It is assumed you understand binary numbers. Coding is introduced without a lot of explanation of Java Script syntax or methods or what actually happens when you write a line of code. The idea of hiding an image within an image is interesting but I do not see that as important for beginners web developers- how is this relevant to building a web site?",3
18555,"it started off as being for beginners but after a while it was rushed and made it extremely difficult for beginners to keep up. Please dont just tell the student to go and write the code for something without giving a hint. Also, there were math mistakes in the course material that are easy to fix.",3
18603,"thank u so mach for this course it was simple and pretty good for the first 2 weeks i really enjoyed it :) ; but the other two weeks though ... i had a hard time there , if you try to improve it , the js wasn't understandable at all or at least mention in the course info that js background needed !!",3
18631,"Well, I think I learnt some things about JavaScript, HTML and CSS. However, the course hasn't been focused on programming with JavaScript to solve real problems. All assignments are based on the creation of images from scratch, the modification of these images and hide messages in an original image. I really don't think these types of assignments can help students to learn Web technology. In fact, I know some professional Web programmers that they don't use javascript to manipulate images but in some cases when it is really necessary. I'd change the way of how the assignments are presented to prove the students' skills. For example, a possible assignment could be the implemention of a counter on a Web page using JavaScript or the creation of a web page with buttons, emerging messages, menus etc. On the web (Googling), there are a lot of codes that allow these funcionalities and could be used and modified by other students to create their own Web page.",3
18637,"Introduced me to some cool ideas, web services and ideas for basic web design but isn't really a beginner course. I've switched over to a similar course from University of London.The lecturers in this course were very stiff and scripted and not overly simplistic in their explanations- something essential to avoid frustrating those of us just starting out. If you want a course that teaches you the basics from the true beginning but doesn't make you feel like you're an idiot for not understanding try Responsive Website Basics from the U of London & Goldsmiths.",3
18638,"This course is divided into 4 weeks. The first two weeks are about CSS and HTML. I started this course as a beginner and was able to keep up with it for the first two weeks. Week three material isn't explained at all and for a beginner, it is very difficult. I wouldn't recommend this course to a beginner at all. What i did like about the course was that the material is organized but that doesnt help if you dont understand what is being taught. I dropped out of this course at week 3. Good Luck.",3
18643,its very good for beginners.,3
18646,Really frustated with this course. Lacks of explanation on the javascript part. Don´t think is recommended for beginners.,3
18656,All the basics for beginners. Some step by step and some things make you think and research more references. I think that's a great combination.,3
18661,"The first week was a bit slow, but things picked up a bit after that. If you have programming experience, this course is not very challenging.",3
18669,This course lost focus in later half and I nowhere I felt learning JS but just using JS as a tool to learn most of Image manipulation techniques.,3
18691,Too much short for a vast and challenging topic like digital manufacturing.,3
18694,"Not to much of interesting, but interesting",3
18706,"The peer-review assignment is not properly designed. From my own experience, colleagues tend to underestimate other people's projects. In addition, the peer-review had an extra/optional advanced component (analysing criminal patterns for a second city; comparing patterns across two cities), which I carried out but got no extra credit for. The extra work was not even part of the assignment classification -- there should be a bonus question for students who carry out the advanced part of the assignment!",3
18717,Nice lectures with lot of good information. AWC setup instruction need to update according new AWC interface.,3
18718,Very interesting subject. Nevertheless the training course material is too theorical.,3
18722,"OK, but obvious for someone who has worked with data science.",3
18733,"This course deals with Cloud Migration and change management. The technology is treated not as strongly. This okay, but I whish there would be more case studies and practical examples. Sometimes it is more like a course about change management and looses connection to the Cloud topic. However along the course there is valuable information provided.",3
18766,"The material is very useful, however, the second teacher is not the best...",3
18769,"The Probability section could use more practical examples, I found it difficult to follow.",3
18800,There are a number of cryptic instructions that really don't need to be hidden. Simpler instructions would make the course more effective for those who aren't developers in their day-job.,3
18804,Tutorials was not matching skills to achieve assignments given. Due to that was involved many ad-hoc works which may not the best practice.,3
18821,"The course was good, but what disappointed me was that the assignments were more focused on java script and less IoT. Also the lectures were short and fast at times, the instructor would move thru the demos so quick or show pages and not provide a detail description of what we were looking at, making things very confusing. At times for example I would look at the screen he was showing on the services running or docs and I was like where do I find this in BlueMix and what does all these nodes, services, etc.. mean? None of that was explained and if they were it was at a very high level. The assignments were not honest with the time estimates. Not sure about the others but I must have spent countless hours and nights working on these with little guidance or direction which would have saved me countless of wasted hours. The forums were not monitored frequently, and when I got responses they were late as by that time I figured my issues or some of the suggestions offered were cryptic not giving me any hints or letting me know if my approach was in the right direction.Either way, this course is very hard to do while also working on a full time job and travelling. With those aspects I hope that the forums are monitored by the instructors for a quick feedback loop and the lectures are updated to be more detailed. The only way I was able to finish this was because I worked 8+ hours each day and late night, and all weekends trying to make sure I finish by the end deadline (the last thing I wanted was this being monkey on my back for the next few more weeks).The positive is that I learned about BlueMix offerings and lastly I can play around now with the Raspberry Pi and do some real IoT and less Java scripting.",3
18828,"The course experience was a little bit weird. It's too easy for a dedicated programmer or IT person, but there are some obstacles to a person who are not familiar to the Javascript programming. (And maybe Python programming, too.) The main problem is too small community. I wrote some, but never got any answer. I think it's due to the charging policy of this lecture.",3
18846,"This was a decent class to get started on programming a Raspberry Pi and hooking it up to a web service. The material was easy to follow and the instructions were precise. With this class, you'll be in a position to create interesting applications using the Raspberry PiThere were two negatives to this class:1) Most of the assignments used the Node Red environment. This is a visual programming tool. Although it's easy to use, I would have preferred programming using a more widely used and more powerful environment.2) The auto grader for the class was not very robust and did a poor job of giving feedback on why things weren't passing. Several times, the assignment would pass in my environment but fail in the auto grader due to (incorrect) assumptions that the auto grader was making about implementation.Overall, this was a worthwhile course but could use some improvement.",3
18855,A broad collection of different subjects. But only a part of it met my interests.,3
18868,"Good lectures and content but the guidance for the assignments are not particularly clear. At times, it feels like grading parameters and questions are just loosely coupled.On a more personal level, I found that the deadline at the end of the same week of the lectures does not allow for a lot of time to ponder and digest the information. I've tried a few other MOOCs; they all granted students the week after the lecture to prepare for the assignment.",3
18869,A littler redundant when you compare it to the previoud courses.The map part is good.,3
18871,"Great course; only limited by the requirement for peers to review the assigned visualization to complete the course. Although I turned my assignment in well-ahead of the due date/time, I had to transfer to the following class because I could not get the required peer reviews (2) prior to the course closing, despite multiple requests in the discussion forum for assistance.",3
18876,This course is only useful if you have no experience visualizing data.,3
18877,The assignment for week 2 should have been the last assignment in this sequence and was not clearly explained or taught in the videos.,3
18893,The overall information in this course was very informative and in some aspects rewarding as refreshers as where the mindset is with some population standards. from a technical perspective I am not sure the system is working at 100%.,3
18905,The data document for assignment is a mess.,3
18906,I enjoyed the hands-on aspect of this course. I learned more about using Tableau from it that the prior courses in the specialization. I give this 3 of 5 stars for 3 reasons:1) My classmates and I think that the instructor left one video out the course which is necessary to answer one of the quiz questions.2) The instructions for at least 2 of the peer-graded assignments are incomplete. The grading criteria requires features that aren't mentioned in the instructions. As a result you need to alter and resubmit the assignments in order to meet all the grading criteria.3) The instructor repeats himself in the course videos. He's present a summary of the video while displaying a Tableau screenshot and then repeat the same summary while displaying a Presentation slide. I feel that more time should have been spent reviewing the Tableau features and eliminate the repetition of the material.,3
18935,"It is ok, and not as good as the marketing class from warton",3
18948,"Just three stars for the topic chosen Grainger, a bit to complicated and sometimes not strait-forwarded tasks.",3
18949,Lack of information and clear direction. I could have produced a more cohesive document if all of the deliverables were described from the beginning.,3
18950,"It wasn't structured that well, Plus most of had to make a digital marketing report for the first time without even a sample of how industry experts expect to see when they look ata repot",3
19018,"The course is very helpful, but it's an extremely messy program and needs more work done to it.",3
19027,"I've been to college, so I'm not the target audience for this course, but I was curious to see what would be covered and to learn more about colleges today. I felt the course covered mostly simplistic, obvious stuff and left out a lot that many students wonder about.One topic that was covered was the different activities of professors. I wished I'd known more about this when I started college. Of course I knew they did research, but I thought they were primarily there to teach. This is true at some colleges, but at others, the amount and quality of research can determine whether a professor gets to continue working there and reach tenure. So teaching may not be the first priority for some professors. Students may find that chunks of courses are devoted to a professor's research interests, which could enrich or derail the course. This could have been covered in more depth.Other things that could have been covered: why some courses are so large and the function of recitation sections and graduate teaching fellows for those and smaller courses; what a seminar is; the existence of course reviews that can help with selecting classes and professors; how to deal with not getting into a course you really need to take (wait lists, professorial overrides, etc.); when pre-requisite courses are really necessary and when they're just recommended; dropping courses; GRADES (how the college grading system works, what happens when you fail a course, academic probation, earning honors); campus codes of conduct (greater freedom as with class attendance; smoking and drinking rules, harassment policies) and disciplinary actions (disciplinary probation, expulsion); good campus activities for shy students.",3
19038,"I really appreciate the attempt of the course; what I got is that we should trust good research and that claims need to be proved. The problem though was the approach, in my opinion. I felt that someone was giving me the right answer for everything and I wasn't supposed to think about it all.I would rather focus my attention on the large gap between reality and ""scientific"" claims. The power of a cost-benefit analysis is enormous and it could be even broader with a personal interpretation and with a high level of awareness.Well done with the aim of the course, just develop the approach impact.p.s the part with the guy that is apparently in Asia is really chaotic and I couldn't follow that amount of short videos.",3
19047,"To be completely honest, I was expecting more from this course. One big setback is that the course material does not really go into biochemical fundamentals of what is going on, and instead jumps straight into algorithms. This might work for someone with enough background in biology who needs to learn to code. I, on the other side, have already had some exposure to software development and algorithms, but when Pavel mentions gene expression and transcription I have a very vague idea what he is talking about.",3
19211,"It was good, and i learnt a lot, but it vexed me that in the first lesson they stated you didn't need to read music to get on with the course, but everything from then on seemed to require reading music including an very difficult final test reading some complicated Beethoven apparently! I understand why they did it that way, as they are used to reading music, but music can also be described as actual note names and the theory will be learnt nevertheless, without the massive barrier of having to translate it all from musical notation.",3
19227,"They just throw all the material at you without giving you enough explanations or exercises. This situation gets worse in the last two weeks and you can hardly breathe. It is like, ""Okay now we have learned that 1+2=3. Let's talk about calculus.""",3
19232,"Pretty good in overall, but there are a few points that could be improved:- The content is taught in a weird order and the difficulty doesn't increase steadily. For example, week 4 and 5 feel like they have been made separately and about the same subject, but week 5 goes further. The last video of week 5 is interesting, but it seems improvised...- There could be more examples, especially from modern music. John from week 5 uses examples from the Beatles, which is great, but he's the only one. Week 3 has pretty much no examples at all.- Suppplementary material and notes are uneven from week to week. Week 2, 4 and especially 5 have good summaries of the videos and examples, but week 3 almost only has links to wikipedia...- The final exam is VERY difficult. There are some crazy chords and rhythm to analyse and there are advanced questions on points which have been seen very quickly in the videos.I can't really compare since I new some of the content of the class, but I think it's weel made for beginners as well as for intermediate musicians. But you'll probably need to do a bit of research yourself if you want to be ready for the exam.",3
19247,YOU TURN ME ON,3
19258,"The course material itself is good and you do learn a lot but for a course that starts at complete beginner level the final exam is too much of a reach for many. It feels like the course should be at least 50% longer as in that exam you are literally trying to stitch ideas together into educated guesses (i got 80% plus on all of the course work). It needs work to narrow the gap as this is not good learning, it frustrates many and is not helpful.",3
19274,"a little too much for my taste, but I learned a lot cellular biology.",3
19276,"Lots of good parts to the course. Found the ODE examples very useful. Feel like it tailed off at the end in terms of detail and utility. Also, it seemed less adapted to the format than other courses such as Machine Learning by Andrew Ng and Computational Neuroscience by Rajesh Rao.",3
19294,"Excellent course as far as content is concerned. However, the older Coursera format was way more user-friendly. Also the discussion topics were not arranged appropriately as in the previous modules in this specialization. PDFs of assignments would be helpful if posted.",3
19317,Great instructor!The content is basic and with appropriately narrow scope of theory and applications.,3
19354,"Although overall the course is interesting, it is clear that it has not been designed for MOOC format. A clear structure for learning lacks, and some of the lectures seem to be more about the people talking about their own work than trying to convey general concepts in the drug discovery field. I think the course would benefit from more structure in the way the lessons are presented, starting with a more general outline of what a good drug is etcetera. However, there are some interesting concepts I can take along in my further studies, but I am slightly disappointed.",3

19641,"I cannot say much about the content, as I`m not a native speaker and can`t really decide about the quality of the language used.I really appreciate that we have the possibility to join online-classes but this courses made me have mixed feelings.1) I missed a proper Introduction - even tho Week 1 had a brief Introduction, I felt from the beginning like I was thrown in thr middle of a class starting somehwere2) The animated clips are quite nice, but the power point presentations were really old-fashioned. I think it might look more professional if there`d be a modern design as well.3) The teachers are quite difficult to rate. But I actually felt like in point one, even tho I was listening and understand what they were talking about, I didn`t felt related to any certain situation or example. Again, I felt like joining a class in the middle of the course.4) Writing some words big, some words small. In Titles/Headlines I understand that, but why do they write words like ""Negative or Highly Sensitive"" big within a text or in another text ""negative or highly sensitive"" ? There are no things like nouns in english most of the times, so why? That doesn`t look really professional to me.5) Lessons mentioned that didn`t seem to happen, like in week 2 or week 3 they referred to a previous lesson which never happend?6) Paying for the Quiz. I understand I joined the free audit and I`m really thankful to have access to all the material. But reviewing a quiz without paying would be useful even for people who don`t pay. As I`d love to know which things I did correct or which words I could use instead.",3

Overall, since it was 101 and basic, I enjoyed learning the new information.",3
19744,"In all it's a good course to know some basics, but the data and some of the informations are out of date. It seems most datas are from late 2012 early 2013, things have changed.",3
19751,"Good info, but a bit outdated and dull.",3
19758,Teaches a lot of the basics but all the numbers are outdated (from 2013)there is minimal use of this being a video course.,3
19782,"Good introduction, QSTK not an optimal tool and many of the things were a tad too general. Technical analysis as a whole is a bit sketchy subject but this course gives a good intro to it.",3
19787,"The course content is not up to date. The course software tools updated 3 years ago, and the second part of the course does not cover in the same depth the topics it aims to cover.",3
19790,"Good introduction to Pandas. Interesting information, but not that information dense compared to other courses. Musical intros and outros on videos waste too much time. Too many ""ums"" and ""ahs"". Later assignments can be hard to get exactly right due to bugs in QSTK and also uncertainty around event counts. Would have liked to be able to discuss work-in-progress code more, but understand that it's tough to manage cheating in an online course.",3
19794,"interesting topic, but teaching is not so attractive.",3
19823,Listening to Tucker Balch talk is a pain. He keeps repeating himself... Not much content in the latter half of the course,3
19834,Some of the data that gets pulled in from the QSTK package is missing for the exercises. It takes a bit of work around to get to the final data set.,3
19866,"The scoring of the Peer Review, was not really measurable of your effort.",3
19971,Good content and GREAT assignments. Main problem is that the lecture videos are unscripted and could easily be made more concise. The other thing that worried me was that most of the assignments that I peer reviewed had missed large parts of the question. I would rather have my work marked by people who have read the question properly.,3
20002,well!!it was interesting.,3
20192,"This course will be a good revision if you have known the models before taking it. But if you are new to the models, you may not really understand them. This course tells you which models to use and how to implement, but does not tell you the rationale behind (maybe the theories are too difficult).The teaching staff are really helpful and answer every question you raise in the discussion forum.",3
20199,Some of the terminology doesn't seem congruent with what we use in North America,3
20200,"The course it's great , however in my opinion it's too theoretical with few practical examples.If you're confortable with matrices and mathematics this course will provide you with very interesting tools and demostrations.I don't think that the course is for casual students, as it's very specific.",3
20216,"it's fine, not technical but ok",3
20217,"The teacher seems to mainly read the slides and the tone is quite scholastic, not a lot or engagement. Indeed the course gives some info on the social background of doping, on how it is fought and it is adopted. Worth it if you have a strong interest in sports.",3
20228,"The material covered in the course is adequate and relevant to various aspects to our social lives. The course's purpose is to get you acquainted with the broad field of emotion study, to pique curiosity and fuel further research and deep dives into the multiple topics that are presented. It does this very well by offering lots of references to research papers, articles and videos. The course doesn't aim to dig deep into its topics. This remains as your task depending on your interests. As a final note, and this is critique I've already submitted, the presenter doesn't add too much to the slides in the videos. He basically reiterates what is written on the slides and doesn't expand on it much or at all. You're basically given links and references to what to learn by yourself. Hopefully this will change in future reiterations of the course.",3
20232,"The lecturer and his avatar are funny, the course content is structured but the delivery is a bit loose...",3
20235,"It was a fairly good course, the professor is funny and the slideshow itself is well made, but the content sometimes got boring and my mind stepped away from the course, something that did not happen even with other more difficult courses.",3
20236,"It wood be interesting, but unfortunatly Prof. Vallverdú's English is quite hard to understand. The scripts are therfore nearly unreadable. What a pity!",3
20237,"A useful overview, but I think this course tries to be too many things all at once. It would have been better to break the philosophy, the ethics, and the science of emotions into separate courses. There is a lot of confusion and oversimplification in the considerations of consciousness and self awareness, and the implications of those things for emotions in humans, that would I think have had a better treatment, if the prof had pruned out some of the other stuff (perhaps ethics, or artificial intelligence, for example).",3
20243,not enough content - would have preferred more examples/scenarios that included conflict resolution solutions,3
20250,I didn't feel like I learned much. Some of the problems I've experience would take more than just trying to find common interest and compromise.A lot of conflicts arise from personal agenda and gain and that's very difficult to deal with.,3
20251,There was anything innovating in the course and the intro of each lesson was extremely loud.,3
20252,"I wish there were another conflict specialization on Coursera to choose from.. one that is more modern, up to date, interesting, engaging, less patronizing .. etc. but there isn't. So I guess we're all stuck with this one. Need I say more.",3
20254,"Good, basic information on conflict resolution. Interviews were very valuable.",3
20266,Simple and easy to follow,3
20279,Should have been a complete course. The course did not give specific tools to conflict resolution rather information about the subject was disseminated,3
20283,The course was very simplistic and more targeted to a new manager or a student who has never taken a conflict resolution course. I only found the interviews with Karen and Joseph to be of interest. The instructor's teaching style is too monotone - I didn't get a sense of her real world experience coming through. No sense of her brand.,3
20298,This a basic course and covers the Collaborative style in some depth. The case studies are the clinchers. I would have loved to have more on the other styles as well.,3
20317,"Overall it was good. However, the content delivery could have been better.",3
20323,"Good and straightforward content but with so very little written excercises and thus very little room for lecturer feedback - I would not pay an additional 100$ just to get rated like that (I might consider it if the price included the mentioned books though). Still - I find it a very well designed, concise course. Thank you!",3
20359,I really enjoyed the presenter who was engaging and interesting. I didn't enjoy the podcasts.,3
20472,"Good, but could have been a little more demanding.",3
20537,"This course is good; but not the best. In some videos, the instructor was hard to understand and I had to turn on closed captions.",3
20560,Very nice course. It is a pity that the legal framework is almost exclusively focused on the US.,3
20563,A very interesting course and a good introduction to the topic. Would be beneficial if one could gain official credits or points towards an online degree with an expanded/more in-depth course volume.,3
20565,Most of the lectures were very short. I would have preferred more in depth discussion of the topics,3
20576,"A example of the Capstone quiz, could made this course best. I suggest to give example of a business idea analysis and also lecture on it.",3
20580,"The lectures made by the professor were really helpful and provided many insights into policy making within the EU. However, some tasks such as filling air pollution standards were not that insightful. Also, unsynchronized subtitles were a bit annoying same for the poor sound from invited professors in air pollution videos of chapters 4 and 5.",3
20592,"The View on Mobile app and Desktop is so different. When I posted week two work an old website I'd built populated. I didn't have time to even notice it. It did not meet assignment rubric. And once my classmates reviewed it and moved on I was forced to switch sessions because ""nobody"" was left to grade any resubmissions. That should have been visible in the mobile app. For a week I kept searching for the ""problem"" and the mobile app said all complete, the desktop assignment tab finally revealed my issue.",3
20631,"The basics covered in this course were useful, however there was minimal interaction with instructors. There was also limited ability to work with the course components, such as lecture transcripts. It woud be a great course if it were a little more accessible.",3
20661,"Although the content was informational, the presenters were uninteresting and made watching the videos hard to do.",3
20695,Course content was pretty detailed. I did not like that I had to write down pretty much every single word from each slide and that was said in order to make sure I could answer the quiz questions. Either the quiz questions were bad or it was taught in a confusing manner. I would go with the former.,3
20701,"It is an interesting course, as a first contact with epidemiology and public health",3
20711,"I enjoyed hearing about epidemiology, but didn't find the quizzes very useful. I was expecting more practice doing computation or examining case studies. The lectures also had no time in between slides to pause, write notes, and make sure I understood what was just said. I liked that the lectures were well organized and the review questions in between the topics of discussion.",3
20769,"Good enough for a free course offering very basic understanding of the topic. Lots of video errors, and sometimes the lecturer's speech isn't very smooth. Tests are poorly worded sometimes in ways that contradict the language used in the lectures, making them difficult to pass even with notes. I wouldn't pay for the certificate - if I were an employer I would not recognize this course as teaching any sort of proficiency.",3
20776,"Fun introduction (I have no background at all in Epidemiology or related fields). However, the material is quite basic, and therefore not very challenging. Still worth the time if you want to get a good idea of what epidemiology is.",3
20781,It was a good basic intro into the statistical methods of epidemiology. Quite basic.,3
20801,there are some fatal problems in its OJ system,3
20881,Good for a basic level but I expected more in this course.,3
20888,"I loved everything about the course content, but peer assessment is a TERRIBLE idea.For one submission I could get both the highest and the lowest grade, without any feedback. Any internet troll could have taken the course and graded participants with the lowest grades possible. Not fun.I have passed the course (89%), but I won't even try another peer assessment based course.It's such an irony that (aspiring) teachers were not able to assess someone else's work properly.",3
20890,"If you are new to teaching ESL, this is probably not a good course. I found the homework used topics that a beginner would not be familiar with. I did like how they used various links to supplement the course (ie a chapter from a interesting text book) to help illustrate points in topics. I may retake the course after I have a foundation.",3
20928,It was very basic. No additional reading.,3
20934,Presentation is good. Concepts explained in a simple and clear manner. Missing interactivity which is very important to retain the understanding of the concepts explained.,3
20983,"Overall, this was good study for learning basic functions in Excel. However, the tutorials and practice quizzes do not adequately prepare you for the actual graded Quiz at the end of each week that counts toward your final grade. You will definitely have to be either a quick study, who can pull a lot of inference and practical application out of minimal technical guidance, or know how to Google the steps that were glossed over in the videos or for which no practice question was provided. Also, side note, if you have a Mac, you will be somewhat flustered at times, and you will also need an add-on app for the Histogram portion.",3
21034,Several of the lecturers are unusually monotonous and do not express excitement about the subject matter.,3
21040,Definitely recommended for people who have no clue about European law whatsoever. Its informative but partly the course fails to set the right priorities. For example: IMHO it makes little sense to ask for numbers of paragraphs in the quizzes - its not only a waste of time to learn them by heart but also it hinders the participants to show their understanding of the material.,3
21062,"Overall good course. Clean and elegant style of presentation. Some videos had some echo problems with the sound. Also there were some english typos in some slides and in video quizzes that should be corrected. I would like to seen the slides for the presentations. Also if this is going to be a series of courses wouldn't it make sense to bundle it in a specialization?Nonetheless, congratulations and thank you for presenting this course in Coursera.",3
21104,First two weeks are too repetitive with other courses,3
21129,"Course is good in general but ""HIERACHICAL CLUSTERING"" part is hard to understand and is not clear, should be explained more.",3
21150,The first two weeks were good. The third was a bit confusing and the 4th one just felt like padding. A more in depth study of ggplot would probably be more beneficial as I felt like we were only scratching the surface with it,3
21195,"A nice introduction to the three plotting systems in R. The second part is devoted to clustering, but it is not detailed enough to be really useful.",3
21216,"The course is quite good and informative in the first two weeks covering a lot of information and a lot of exercises.Week 3 is very unrelated and hard the videos and exercises are bad, and I had to do this part by myself again.Also when we get to the final course project doesn't cover any of these techniques.In my opinion, week 3 should be replaced with something more related to plotting systems and distributions, also one project would be enough.",3
21227,I wish there several comprehensive examples of exploring some real data as guided by the course instructors.,3
21228,"Course feels somewhat abandoned by instructors. Content is okay, but can't help the feeling that it's basically a cash cow - students would benefit a lot if instructors were move involved.",3
21238,The course covers very limited subset of plots and mostly oriented to R-specific technical routines rather than overall approaches. Case-study example is helpful and contrary to the most comments I do appreciate the final course project: this how most problems are stated in real life. If you would like to cover more fundamental concepts behind exploratory analysis I would recommend other sources.,3
21253,Good class - links and slides have not been updated recently. Frustrating to finish without the exact linkts to the data.,3
21257,"Good course, but the SWIRL exercises (and a few quiz questions) needed to be updated for the latest version of ggplot2.",3
21259,"A lot of broken swirl(), which wouldn't be so bad except *a lot* of this course is based entirely on swirl(). Also the swirl() text was almost verbatim of the lectures one has just watched.All in all, good information, but the swirl() badly needs an update.",3
21275,It misses an assignment which will allow to practice the clustering skills.,3
21280,"Interesting stuff, but not a lot of detail",3
21282,The course content applies to R. The teachers focused on the programming language rather than the application of the existing graphs to explore data.,3
21283,"Good course overall. There tends to be many lectures that are just lists of commands. Also, they don't seem to be updating the material. Many lectures are several years old and still have typos in them.",3
21291,"Excellent overview of plotting and clustering. However, there were a few bits that were required for good completion of the projects that weren't covered in detail. Overall an excellent course and specialization.",3
21305,"Insights delivered by the course were great. However, I think it emphasizes too much the lattice and basic plot systems to the point it is redundant with functionality on ggplot. It should focus more on concepts and techniques for delivering richer and meaningful graphics using ggplot rather than talking that much about technicalities on the basic plot and lattice systems.Assignments were too basic and don't reflect all the concepts learned in the lessons e.g. clustering, which I think are of great interest for researchers.",3
21345,Great course materials.Found it difficult to form groups of students and meet up for the activity cases.,3
21389,"Lots of information, but could be presented in a more learner-friendly manner. Not a lot of information for someone who wishes to learn about organic/holistic dairy management.",3
21404,"Good course, teaches how are actually big dairy enterprises, in a country with unlimited resources, it`s not usefull in develeping countries, and doesn`t teach how to understand the way to start a business and the differences in small, medium, big and gigantic business in diary production. Aren`t there any small diary farm en USA ? It`s not feaseble to start a small diary business in USA? How different in costs and profit are diary in different countries?, How USA government helps diary business in USA? Thanks for your teaching and Sharing your experiences.",3
21458,"Good course to start with the basics of photography. Group assessments can be hit or miss given varied experiences of other students, but overall a good place to start",3
21480,"The course covered the material thoroughly, but the presentation could be improved: 1. the examples, charts and other helpful aside additions could be left on screen during the relevant discussion. I often had to pause and go back to study the material that was only briefly displayed. 2. Using the screen for just a video of the lecturer speaking seems a waste of the many video techniques that could be included, with the lecturer in a small window at the side. 3. Although the lecturers tried not to favor one brand over another, at times it seemed like we were watching an infomercial. Maybe this can't be helped, as all the camera's features, and their accessories, were described in detail. I for one have a camera that I want to learn to use more professionally. Purchase suggestions could be moved to an addendum. In my opinion it should not be in the body of the course material.I am finding a lot of good information in the course, and am continuing with the second section.",3
21510,"The content is helpful in learning to use the camera and understand terminology, but it is somewhat, if not totally, a false representation of interaction with the experts. There is absolutely none.",3
21522,thanks,3
21540,"Very basic content, not that helpful - states what to pay attention to, but scarcely ""how to"". Also is very static, uses very little illustrations / animations / visuals, which is a shame for a photography course...",3
21562,"The content of the course is good and I feel it would be beneficial for beginners or those who want to top up their technical / academic knowledge on the subject.I found the terrible editing of the lectures distracting though, and it felt like no one bothered to over-see the final version that was published. I also don't think the fact that one has to pay so much to access the assessments, which many other courses don't do at all, is conducive to creating a strong engagement in the course. I wouldn't for example be encouraged to take another course from this series (not sure if one is offered).",3
21571,Course contents are not very well organized.,3
21574,not really possible to give a higher rating.at the moment too many problems.,3
21584,"The course would be great if only everybody could fully participate. As I cannot pass quizzes and submit assignments not having purchased it, I have less motivation to carry on :(",3
21604,Pros:Good concepts. Peter Glanding is a very good teacher.Cons: Too short and concepts explained too quickly.,3
21610,There were some technical challenges that made this course not as fun. The content was good. If you make the assignments easier to submit (for example: provide a box to write a statement as opposed to uploading one) it will remove frustration and increase enjoyment.,3
21633,"It was quite confusing with unlocking next weeks work, and the filming of the videos were poor. Eventhough everything was understandable",3
21648,"The content, although very basic, is interesting, and some of the teacher's insights do stimulate discussion, but the video quality is low, with non matching slides, etc.",3
21656,This course could have delved in more depth in the respective subject. What was presented was good but I felt that more could have been presented.,3
21662,"The course was very interesting. It touched upon all currently employed techniques in good detail. The lab-based videos were the most interesting. However, the lectures were too long. It would be a brilliant course if the lectures were cut short and made to the point.",3
21702,It is a course made in 2014,3
21705,"Thanks so much for a solid course that covers all the main pillars for understanding the structure and philosophy of the Union. Particularly important in those time of crises in which, the raise of populism and far right political agenda is being used as a tool to assign responsibility to the EU to failures at national level. Lack of transparency and accountability in addition to a lack of leadership is the real responsible of this crisis of credibility.Is for this reason that its essential to educate people around the meaning of the EU and this course fully achieves this goal. Only one point to take it into account that is regarding the feedback from peers. In my case were not quite useful, without almost no analysis and without understanding the meaning of the assignment in itself. It´d be good to further consider this aspect and/or see other alternatives like the intervention of the facilitator.",3
21721,"The course is structured in an efficient way. However, it does not offer an unbiased opinion about EU as can be seen from the title of the course. There are many things that can be improved in EU and a more critical approach would be a lot more helpful. Overall, this course has an above average quality with an acceptable level of engagement.",3
21726,"In general, the instructors seem to think it's a better learning experience to give the bare minimum in R, then have the student 'hack' their way to the answer using online forums, etc. While I get the motivation, I think it'd be better to give a more experiential learning platform - more swirl type exercises but deeper - to guide the student to the most efficient path to competency.",3
21727,"To get value from the class, I used other on-line materials to understand the topic. Thus, I spent about 20 hours/week on this class.",3
21732,"brought up some good concept inside, like ""tidy data"", but not in detail, how to grab data from different source shouldn't be difficult. should have more focus on talking about data.table, ""tidy data"" principles etc.",3
21735,"Would have preferred if there were programming assignments that incorporated reading from data sources on the web.For those planning to take the course, note the following:*The course covers reading data from a myriad of sources, but largely in passing superficial detail. These sources include XML files, mySQL databases, HDF5 files, csv files, txt files with various formats (for example fixed-with files), JSON objects, and web API.However, the course project only involves reading data from several txt files and combining them into a single R dataset.Course topic order: In the first two weeks of the course, a lot of information is glossed over in passing- this information involves reading from the various file formats mentioned above. Week 3 involves subsetting, sorting, reshaping and merging data. Some of this may be review for you if you've taken the R programming course or the ""R Programming Environment"" course in the ""Mastering Software Development in R"" specialization. Week 4 involves string manipulation, regular expressions and working with the Dates. A lot of this is covered in Roger Peng's ebooks ""R Programming for Data Science"" and ""Mastering Software Development in R"" (both are freely available- google them).Assessments: The only assessments in the course are 4 quizzes- each of which involves about 5 short programming exercises- and a final project which only involves topics from weeks 3 and 4 (specifically- subsetting data, sorting data, reshaping data, and working with regular expressions). So you can do the course project without understanding anything covered in weeks 1 and 2 of the course.Mentor David Hood is fantastic for providing valuable resources to aid you with each assessment and so is Xing Su for providing a complete set of course notes. USE THE DISCUSSION FORUMS IF YOU GET STUCK!",3
21760,Materials (video and written) only partially prepare the student for the quizzes and course projects.,3
21766,"Lectures add very little to what you get simply by looking at the slides on your own. Facilitators are expert biostatisticians, not R programmers, and sometimes their explanations of R functionality is superficial and imprecise. The assignments are rigorous and challenging, however, and if you take the time to go through all of the exercises you will gain valuable knowledge.",3
21770,The course isn't that hard but there is a lot of content to assimilate.,3
21802,"decent enough but this is a heavy subject and really it is not that interesting although clearly necessary. I feel maybe it could have been organized better to make it more interesting Also reading some of Haldey wickhams book he deliberately keeps this part of Data Science away from new learners as it can be a bit dreary, so my recommendation would be to do some of the other courses first.",3
21836,"This course provides a lot of methods and strategies about reading data, manipulating data. But I think some important issues in the real world are not discussed enough here, like how to treat missing values, how to deal with messy format data.",3
21838,"Course is too simple, should be more extensive.",3
21870,The best course so far (though that's not saying much). This course would be better as a follow up to an example workflow showing an end to end analysis.,3
21877,Interesting but too simple.,3
21879,good course. but some concepts are hard to understand for newbies. so felt it was a bit advanced in parts.,3
21884,Very usefull but can be technical and discouraging,3
21891,"Contents in first half weeks are very superficial, have low depth so that do not help me do some meaningful studies. But later ones are good for understanding the structure of data.",3
21896,Not well explained.... Previous module was better structured.,3
21900,Topics were OK but the focus on R and no other tools is frustrating,3
21914,"The content of the course is good, but it seems abandoned - some links are outdated or don't work. I think it would be a much better experience for students if these first courses in the specialization got more love from the instructors.",3
21920,"I liked it, but I had the impression it wasn't as prepared as the other courses. Especially with the course assignment I had a bit trouble to understand, what was wanted.",3
21928,Peer reviewed assessment with students who are unsure of the correct answers = unsure if solution is correct. Perhaps a formal process (same as previous course where a SHA commit is submitted and source is automatically downloaded (and plagiarism detected) & run to verify the output that columns / data meet an acceptable criteria,3
21929,less hands-on exercises and this course covers too much topics without details. More like general intro to each tool and data sources. Swirl is still a great package for practice.,3
21946,This course is of lower quality than the preceding courses. The final assignment instructions are not clear. The forums helped but I have the impression that they are not really followed by the mentors.,3
21949,"The evaluation part of the course needs some fixing. Otherwise, very good course!",3
21955,"There were a lot of good nuggets in here, but overall this course felt somewhat disjointed compared to the others. It would be nice to have more practice with some of the different formats (e.g., JSON) and for exercises to loop back to some of the early content. I did like that the final exercise required a fair amount of investigation into understanding the documentation and relationship between the files before undertaking to code.",3
21961,Toughest class in the offering. There really could've been 2 classes for cleaning data. I struggled with the lecturer's style (spoke too fast).,3
21969,"The content of the course is too general, with too brief introduction of some commands in the lecture notes(slides), I don't think it would be very helpful for the students to deal with some real complicated problems.",3
21989,"Hi all,Course provides interesting insight to getting and cleaning data. However, the course misses practical examples (not only showing the code in the slides, but also presenting how it works in R or RStudio).",3
21993,very nicely made course providing a good hands on with R language. Thanks!,3
21996,Sometimes is hard to follow,3
22001,"The materiel covered in the course was great, but more assignments instead of quizzes should be added.",3
22012,"In some weeks only about an hour of input where several topics have already been covered in R Programming. That's very little value for money.The final course project again feels like it's done in a rush and without another review: The submitted dataset should be automatically checked. It's simply impossible to derive from it whether the student did everything right, but it could be easily done programmatically. Some of the questions have wording and grammar issues that make it hard to understand. Also there is slightly contradicting instructions between the task and review description.",3
22028,"The course is good, but it doesn't really offer all the tools required to pass the exams. I had to take extra courses in other place in order to pass. In addition, the exams some times become a bit too subjective of what the classmates want to grade you.",3
22037,"The lecture material was high level, and didn't seem to be a good preparation for the quizzes.The description for the final project was not very detailed, and the grading rubric likewise was not very specific for peer review.",3
22043,"The selection of topics is great. However, the course is too abstract. I think some of the materials deserve to be discussed more comprehensively.",3
22048,"The content in this course is essential, but the delivery is patchy and the course project is hard to complete with just the learning materials provided. Read around the course and visit the data science specialisation wiki for extra information, and work through it at your own pace, rather than that suggested by the course. It's much easier to do this now it's on the new Coursera platform :o)",3
22051,"This is not a beginner's course, so a decent grasp of the R language is necessary. It is best to take this course after some stints with Data Camp, Swirl, or Code School.",3
22065,Awesome course! Intensive learning. I recommend a few studies of astronomy before take it.There are some issues with the feedback of others proffesors,3
22115,the teacher is boring. other then that its an ok class. need to explain things more.,3
22158,Some of his information was useful. It's pretty basic.,3
22163,Good Course and Professor very clear. But a lot of content (40%) is for USA.,3
22165,"There is a lack of supervision by the instructor. Some questions are too simple and basic, and don't really prompt much of any reflection upon the course material presented. I feel like participation in the forum posts was also weak. All in all, it was a good class for basic financial knowledge (e.g. financial terms, different investment vehicles, etc.)",3
22222,The capstone project was too simple and not sufficiently challenging,3
22274,The app is neat but too short.,3
22275,Very poorly constructed with links in the final exam that didn't work so I couldn't finish the exam. Then I was graded after only finishing 4/5 of the exam. I managed to get everything straightened out but it took some effort.,3
22284,"Fun. Challenging with gamification.Maybe it's a little short.I was expecting to put in a lot of work in this capstone maybe because I was expecting a more thorough, longer analysis challenge.So a recommendation is:In the same style, create more weeks where the challenges will increase.",3

22616,Very basic overview of the topic. Did not meet my expectations.,3
22646,Volume too low.... need more concrete examples.Thank you for your effort though. I learned from the course.,3
22648,The course is good for getting an overall idea of the main topics of finance but not on getting a deep understanding on them,3
22662,I've missed at least one practical exercises on each module.Overall is good.,3
22693,It was a bit confusing to understand the topics and try to learn them by heart.,3

22709,"it was very simple , but i expected more content",3
22711,"Quick and easy. But I would have liked more examples. For instance, how NPV and IRR actually works on Excel. Luckily, I have some prior knowledge of the subject, but sometimes it was not so clear for a complete beginner.",3

22724,Not a bad overview but overall far too shallow to be of significant worth on its own.,3
22728,A very quick overview of finance. Good review of fundamentals but not a lot of depth.,3
22738,"This is a good course to introduce the novice to financial terms used in common place.But in my opinion, the instructor could have a gone a bit further, explaining about Markets, Stocks, Bonds etc.Types of transactions involved.Maybe its expecting too much, but still, just a suggestion",3

22973,"An excellent course as a short overview or as an introduction to a specialization.Seemed to touch on neurology and evolution more than genetics. Didn't get into the mechanics of genetics or molecular biology as much as I had hoped. Read Genetics for Dummies and reviewed my old textbooks to refresh on topics I found interesting and this was a nice course to accompany that endeavor. I really enjoyed the short segment near the end that delved into the field of biotechnology.Thank you so much for providing this as a self-paced class, I really enjoyed taking it.",3
22977,"Large topic and well presented. Due to volume could perhaps be divided into smaller, more comprehensive,",3
22990,Lots of bias on evolutionary theories.,3
22997,good course a bit hard to understand at times the information can get confusing but the it is there wish they would add printable bulletins at the end so make information readable just for extra help with the understanding of the material,3
22999,The course was pretty good. Maybe concepts were illustrated too general and briefly (not in details) but maybe this course is just a warm up for people who are not specialists in those fields. Nevertheless it was quite fun to listen the lectures and that's why course went pretty fast. I only regret that there's no free Statements of Accomplishment.,3
23017,This course gives you a general overview over nutrition. It is a good start for those who want to have an healthier diet. Personally I already knew most of the information provided and I am a bit further into the 'eating healthy' process. The course is well done anyway and worth a look.,3
23038,I feel like it was rather short and not too detailed,3

23162,Very basic course for American non-healthy food consumers. Would never call it a university course. Not useful for professionals.,3

23202,The course should focus more in health professionals,3
23240,"Incredibly basic- more for the average person rather than a student or professional, but it seems as though that is who the material is directed at- so not a great course if you are a professional looking to increase your knowledge, but great usable information that the average person can easily apply.",3
23288,"This course provided me with some vital knowledge about health and nutrition, however, I consider it to be very short and rather shallow. The issues would require more coverage, than, with some weeks, 15 minutes for the whole week. Another issue is the tests. 50 % margin for passing the exam seems too easy. The videos have great graphics and the issues are well explained. Overaly 3/4 stars.",3

23354,"Really basic info that most foodies will already know. I liked the cooking demos but I am vegan, gluten-free and eat mostly organic already.",3
23364,"The topics discussed into this course are really interesting. The videos give some perspective at the time of taking care of our own health and eating habits.The only problem I see, is the shortness of the course and the videos. The topics don't go beyond the surface and there is a lack of: details, examples, and comparisons between healthy diets and harmful ones.",3
23369,"Short and concise. The course strongly aims for USA residents who eat too much. If you are that person, this course is perfect. As someone from another country without health problems, there was not much here. I was hoping to learn more about food and how to optimize my diet so as to increase energy, improve mood, increase life-expectancy, and reduce chances for depression. I found nothing about that. But it's not so bad because the course took me less than 3 hours and I still picked up a few things :).",3
23383,Starts off informative and then becomes very basic. It felt like it was more for informing families struggling with nutrition than for informative education on health and food.The interview with Michael Pollan that was woven in to each lesson were the main reason to finish the course.,3
23409,basic but interesting,3

23441,"good stuff, but a bit preachy",3
23447,Good for general knowledge about healthy di,3

23506,"Interesting, but not so much new things to know when you've already learned about healthy food. It's ok.It's quite hard because of the english language. :(",3
23512,"Super interesting, but it is a very basic introduction to nutrition. Only the first or second lessons have information about nutrients and how they are different from each other. The other sections you could've gotten from a Michael Pollan book, or one of his documentaries. Nevertheless, very engaging, visually and verbally, and ideal for someone who is getting started on nutrition.",3
23514,I was hoping for something a little more scientific and a little less home-ec-y.,3
23531,This was a very baseline introduction and basically a summary of Pollan's books and ideology. The positive is that is was very accessible in time and presentation however provides little insight to ins,3
23536,good overall conversation about food,3
23566,"Hate the music. And that permanent fake smile and constant nodding. Those are cheap brainwashing techniques which target human cognitive abilities and subconscious to make their words sound more deep and convincing.You often can see such brainwashing tricks in commercials and advertisements which try to elevate some concept or idea but lack any information or facts to back it up. And it is very weird to see same tricks used in this set of lectures, because these ones actually do have a lot of facts and information and arguments behind them.The whole course is basically just blaberring about vegetables. Almost no new or useful information for me.",3
23581,"In the beginning it feels like a course, but from week three on it feels more like a conversation about food. It is more suitable for people with very little background n food science and nutrition, aiming to get some knowl on these fields. But the views are quite one sided and necessarily true when it comes to the understanding of the food chain. Of course, many of their opinions are valid, but I wouldn´t accept those views as solid rock statements because they are not.In any case, I recomend the course for people with obesity problems and those who are too lazy to think about the importance of home cooking.The quality of the videos is outstanding! Congratulations!",3
23591,"Good ""basics"" course. Great for beginners and reminders!I was hoping for something more advanced & was a bit disappointed. I am probably more knowledgeable than most however. The statement made regarding ""eating fruits & veggies regardless of whether they have pesticides or not"" was a bit tough for me as I became ill in part due to pesticides and still am. I might always be. I understand eating veggies in place of other foods (i. e. - processed foods) as I eat very little meat anymore. But coming from Stanford and someone as educated as he is, that was shocking. It makes me wonder who funded this course.",3
23600,"It was filled with a lot of interesting, pertinent information but I did feel that there was not enough variety in terms of interviews and I do wish that she had delved more into some of the topics. I understand it was an overview but I often felt that it was very brief.",3
23699,"It was well presented but a little light on, I was hoping for a bit more ""meat"" to it. But interesting none the less, & a fascinating insight into how few people apparently cook their own food.",3
23702,"Beautifully executed and fun to hear Michael Pollen speak, but sooooo easy. Too easy, really.",3
23718,a tad simplistic - grades should be locked too,3
23730,"extremely short & easy - fun-ducation. Not hugely informative for someone who's looking to learn about the links between what we eat and how we eat, and how human bodies respond. But the instructor is very charming, so it was a pleasant experience. The whole course can be completed in 1-2 hours",3
23747,Way too easy.. I was expecting more information in nutritional science.Still there's some useful tips for us to choose good food and improve our health,3
23762,Interesting and well presented information. I wished the course had been more interactive and had spent more time on the chemistry of nutrition. Also the lectures and quizzes could have been longer.,3
23787,I was hoping for something a little more technical. This course might be good for someone who has no previous knowledge of the nutrition content of food or how to cook. It would be perfect for kids getting ready to head off to college who've never cooked for themselves.,3
23790,"If you have some basic knowledge about food and nutrition, then this course is not the right for you. It's very basic and sometimes trivial. But the lecturer and course itself was really nice.",3
23805,"This seems like a good overview for those new to the kitchen, and/or health concerns more generally. For someone interested in deepening their understanding, it's of more limited value--but it is presented as an introduction. I wish there were readings to supplement the videos.",3
23815,"Overall, I found this course to be a good refresher given my prior knowledge / skill base. I could see this course being very good for absolute beginners with little to no knowledge of nutritional concepts or cooking. I personally was looking for more advanced / in-depth information about nutritional science in order to better equip me to be a knowledgeable resource for my clients (with whom I primarily work around health / wellness related issues). Additionally, the cooking ideas / concepts were all practices that I already utilize in my own kitchen / feeding my own family. One section that I did find incredibly helpful was the discussion about the different types of fats.As it stands, I would definitely recommend this course to a client, friend, or family member starting out at a beginner's level (like my fiance) or anyone who needs a refresher.",3
23817,"To me , you were preaching to the choir. I have been trying to follow Pollan's ideas for years. I was hoping for new information, but for me it was a rehash of stuff I have heard ad infinite. this did not seem like a class. This seemed more like an advertisement for healthy eating with it constant music and sparse content. Certainly it did not have the rigorous content that would have been required in a college level credited class. It was certainly not as interesting nor as informative as the Berkeley class ""edible education 101""Still as an advertisement for good eating it was well done. If you found an audience out there somewhere who had not heard these messages, then you have succeeded and I applaud you for that.",3
23836,"Great class, but a little shorter than I would like and similar to Dr. Adams other Coursera offering.",3
23840,more scientific evidence would have been useful,3
23851,"an easy course, i would reccomend it to novices to nutritional science. If you're a more seasoned nutritionist, move on and find a more challenging course.",3
23856,Way too basic. Only useful to people living in the US having extremely unbalanced diets.,3
23883,"Helpful ideas, but could use some more practical suggestions.",3
23940,"Scattered and lacking focus. The material is all there, but it feels like a laundry list of miscellany that didn't make it into the previous or next course in the specialisation.",3
23992,Some course content are not updated (links not working). Very few people in discussions. Didn't see TAs. I had some questions on the forum but not answered.,3
24018,Gives a basic overview of data collection processes.,3
24028,"Interesting review of historical voting mechanisms and their flaws. Easy to finish in one setting.Not to offend the course instructor, but 'uhm' how can I say 'uhm', every sentence starts, stops and 'uhm, is interjected with filler words 'uh' 'um' etc. Extremely annoying at 1.5x speed.",3
24099,"The Professors were wonderful, issues with wording of questions on tests and grading of tests",3
24100,The course is good for providing introduction to Forensic accounting. What would be good is to include some analytical tools or examples of how exactly text analysis will help us find fraudsters. Overall the pace and content is good.,3
24138,"Positive: It was refreshing to see this offering in Coursera. It is an important topic and there is limited amount of offerings (the Wharton course in accounting analytics crosses in the benfords law topic). The discussions in Madoff, Snowden, etc are positive to stimulate critical thinking. The approach was solid. The videos with real fraudsters were very good allowing to connect the theory to practice. The final exam with 60 questions is also very positive to force/stimulate the student to 'cement' the knowledge gained.Negative: This course was shockingly short. If discounted the weekly videos with real examples of frauds, per week there was only about 20-30 minutes of 'real' materials. This is not nearly enough a balanced output of resources to allow students to grasp the concepts. Institutions like Wharton, U. Michigan, U. Illinois, U. Virginia and Yale are packaging in their top courses/specializations at least 1.5 to 3 hours per module (what can have between 4 and 11 modules), plus resources - slides, readings, excel spreadsheets and others. This is an enormous gap. Also - although it was positive to see the materials of the collegue and acfe sites, more was expected. For example, it would be extremely valuable to have resources related to Bernie Madoff, Armstrong, Edward Snowden to engage on a more dynamic discussion. The slides used to back the video lectures should also been made available. Also in some topics more detail was expected. For example, Benford's Law. It should been shown the formula used, what is the threshold value to raise suspicion that manipulation might be present in the financials and also what are considered to be normal values.Overall it is positive to see your offering but I think it can be improved and add a lot more valuable.I wish you luck.",3
24182,"He talks to0o00o fast and His slides are too wordy and I feel so sleepy When I was watching these videos! (I don't know why)!However As a PhD biomedical Eng, I'm learning alot from this specialization and I highly appreciate them for creating such amazing Idea. I'm Canadian and I know we have lots of similarities with you and I think I should make it for Canada and our university.Sincerely,Azadeh",3
24184,"Some of the lectures were too general, too fast, or left things outI also don't like the peer review type grading structureAlso, I am sure I'm not the only person taking this course (or the whole series), who does not CURRENTLY, have a career in healthcare; I am working towards that - So; to ask us to do a market sizing memo and come up with something from nothing, while swearing not to plagiarize, is not a good method.I'm here to gain knowledge and skills - a broad overview.Perhaps a course or actual 2nd degree in Health Info Tech or Healthcare Admin. is better way to go for me; however, I cannot afford it finance or time - therefore, am trying to learn as much as possible off here.Kudsos to Parente for having super cool interests though - the sailing, the places he sails and the awesome vacation home in the Scottish Highlands!",3
24206,"The course is not very well developed like course 1, 2, 3.",3
24209,Course is good but mentor grading needs to be a bit sorted as in they required almost 2 additional weeks to grade one assignment in total that is 1 month to grade an assignment so that needs to be taken care of,3
24231,"The course is well made. Unfortunately, you will find at least one, minor or fatal, error in every video as well as quizzes. It also doesn't cover all the important subjects, so I would not call it an ""FE Exam Review"" course as the title might be very misleading. The course is good for reviewing the mentioned subjects but don't depend on it as your sole source of review.",3
24232,I am glad that this exist but notice many errors. Every chapter has at least one error. Wish the admin address these issues through the discussion forums.,3
24277,"Whenever examples were given, things became much clearer, but there often weren't examples. In many instances it would have been nice if there had been a second take of the video taken to prevent potentially confusing mis-speaking from making it into the lectures. Obviously you get what you pay for, and it's great that I got a vague overview of the subject for free, but I easily aced the course without feeling like I'm at all prepared to run an fMRI experiment.",3
24278,Instructors tend to talk too fast and read off the slides verbatim instead of thoroughly explaining the topic,3
24317,"Interessante, porém poderia ser melhor elaborado.This course is interesting, but could be better elaborated.",3
24335,pretty good!,3
24351,The course is very elementary and basic. It should be a good intro 101 for those who have never studied mathematical finance. You can also practice using Excel if you have never used it before. It could be more challenging and fun if there were more modeling questions.,3
24384,"The lectures weren't always easy to follow but the quizzes were really useful as they meant it was necessary to understand the material. Definitely a useful course, I will be interested to see how it relates to the real world of derivatives pricing.",3
24415,I wish it could be harder and have more challenging quizzes than simply arithmetic and multiple choice.,3
24433,good learning with explanation on basic financials,3
24447,"The course provides a very thorough introduction on the basic models and mechanisms by which various financial products are priced. One issue I had, was that the quiz questions sometimes used terminology or jargon for which the link with the material covered in the videos was not always immediately obvious. Also, the course, especially the later modules, heavily relies on Microsoft Excel, which some people might not be willing to pay hard cash for. It is possible to pass by doing the assignments with e.g. Python, but it's a lot of work, and not for the faint of heart.",3
24460,"Three stars for course structure, two stars less for every poor course material which doesn't contain any guidance to test questions.",3
24478,"Too high level compared to what I expected, but does give a good overview of the topic.",3
24525,"Overall, this is a good course. It provides many handy tools, frameworks, techniques for data-driven decision making process. It does improve my decision making skill. However, the course is quite short and doesn't have much in-depth content.",3
24528,"This course does a good job overall of framing the importance and challenges of working with big data, and certainly inspired me to want to learn more. However, I think the material could be organized better, and the lectures are not nearly the same quality as the universities' courses...not to mention too heavy on the PWC pitches. The quizzes and assignments don't necessarily correlate well with the lessons, and the assignments are structured poorly. Based on my experience, I would not recommend a PWC course to serious learners.",3
24538,"A good foundation course. I believe the information regarding tools and techniques could've been presented in a better manner by working on live files and displaying it. It was monotonous. Apart from the rest, the final course case studies were brilliant and helped us to collaborate our understanding of the course.",3
24558,I was expecting a lot more detail on ***how*** to perform data driven decision making. What I found is just a lot of buzzwords and very shallow overviews.,3
24566,extremely high level,3
24573,"The course is good for elementary understanding, th exercises were fun too. However, the tools could have been described",3
24584,"The course is extremely helpful and the content is good. However, it is hard sometimes to follow the Principals/Directors teaching the course. Additionally, it would have been fantastic if a lot of time was spent on giving examples, practical work demonstrated and a thorough structure of how it was done.Maybe, all this will be coming in the future courses. But for beginners, it is hard to understand and catch interest on the topic if not discussed with detailed examples and not merely giving highlights on the examples.",3
24652,"Good course for new learners. Switching back and forth between Time Value of Money and the Decisions framework can be off-putting, though. Organisation of material is not necessarily the best, but the course is definitely worth taking for Finance newbies.",3
24691,"Good materials, but too long and drawn out.",3
24698,"Excellent content, but the instructor does not motivate",3
24714,Nice one,3
24728,Nice content but a few bugs with the videos and sound track when watching online.,3
24730,"4/5 for content, 2/5 for presentation. Compared to other courses, the lecturer is slow and often reads from slides. Nevertheless thanks for the course.",3
24774,Maybe a little thin in terms of content; besides interesting,3
24776,In spite of this course being very basic it give you a quick highlight on the fundamentals of management principles.,3
24779,Nice review of all things learned during College.,3
24788,"Just soft teoretical material - need add some ""real life"" exsamples.",3
24791,Good course that gives a basic idea how management works and what is the difference between managers and leaders.,3
24811,"This course is a bit repetitive and provides only a few real life examples. As well as this, the evaluation of this course is based on the result of a single quiz of 15 questions, which is not enough to prove any knowledge at all. I think it should focus on a more practice oriented course in order to master the price optimization process and see how it fluctuates in real life examples.However, this course gives great insights and useful concepts that are of huge importance to the application of the revenue management activities.",3
24819,"While I enjoyed most of the content of this course, I felt that it was one long advertisement for Duetto. I will certainly continue the course series because I enjoy the learning. Also, a note for presenters, please be aware of how distracting so many hand gestures can be. Thanks!",3
24823,Tests and quizzes don't really ask the right things and the answers given are hard to understand. Bad quizzes but lectures informative.,3
24831,"A good course, giving a thorough understanding of the various types of renewable energy, their issues and opportunities. I cannot rate the course higher because some of it is so out of date. It really needs to be re-done. The Paris Agreement wasn't mentioned, some of the research is from the early 2000s, many of the lectures are at least 3 years old. This is an area that is changing rapidly, monthly, and this course can't really be seen to be current any more. Particularly the politics section in week 8.",3
24833,"Too much information for a short amount of time to compile. I liked the questions in the middle of the videos, but I would be great to always have the justification of the answers for a more profund learnning.",3
24849,Nice course with lot of numbers and facts.,3
24891,"The project is too unguided, you can set an example by creating a sample website throughout the course.",3
24893,Took the mystery out of a few things that were new.,3
24898,"It good for beginners who have no idea where to start in creating sites .But, can improve some of the audios are not complete yet the audio has finished and in some of video are not completely organized",3
24902,"too short and not very helpful for me, I was missing more details.",3
24903,"I was really happy to join this class, until I saw there was no video learning, everything is articles. I need something visual. I am sorry but this class is not helpful for me, I do thank you the teachers but please do remove me. Thanks.",3
24904,It's quite simple and doesn't show specific steps of how to do it.,3
24907,Very limited information on Wordpress. Then added some lectures on web design that could have used information relevant to Wordpress such as image compression plugins instead of tinypng.com (see last component).,3
24923,"This course is very helpful to motivate oneself to create a website. But it looks like the authors themselves made the course in one weekend. The lectures are too short and not informative enough to complete the assignments. Some videos don't show what the lecturer is talking about, maybe there is bug or something, but there is only some irrelevant picture. The due dates are inconsistent through different pages. Finally, the next day after the course ends I am not able to view my assignments and the grade for the last assignment, even though the authors sent an email that it would be possible.",3
24925,"The content for teaching how to create website is nothing. The name should change to how to create a website with Wordpress. I found some videos on the internet help more than this course. However, some links and information are very useful.",3
24931,More basic than I was expecting,3
24932,This course is super fast for beginner and i colder find the pause button. Great info but could've been delivered better.,3
24938,Assignments should be free for everyone to try and be peer reviewed! Payment should only affect the certificate.,3
24946,The links provided are informative.,3
24987,"The subject of the course is very interesting. Lectures are very engaging and professors do a great job explaining abstract concepts. On the other hand, assignments are extremely difficult and frustrating. The lack of feedback for the assignments leaves you with important knowledge gaps and that's a serious flaw for a course that offers so much most of the time.",3
24991,Too general... extremely easy to solve the quizzes. I would say needs deeper evaluation of the learned materials.,3
24993,make it more interective,3
25010,First week and last week were pretty useful with some good tips from the videos... the other weeks not so much.,3
25011,"I would like a different approach on the way this course is given to the student. The first couple of classes were really cool and inspiring, but the later two became more of the same and kinda took my inspiration and motivation down to finish the course.",3
25014,"I liked the assignments and the creative ideas discussed in the class. However, I wish there had been more practical, step-by-step instruction in approaching design work; game artists of more diverse styles; and some discussion of game character design as a career.",3
25018,"It was a fun course, not sure about the educational content, but it was fun.",3
25020,Instruction was through watching other characters designers talk about their process.,3
25028,"While the information given by Fran was useful, the part where other artists talk is not presented well.",3
25033,"Very open way of learning. Few talks with people from the industry, sharing their approach.Not much of fundamental knowledge.Generally great motivator to exercise Character Design. Not that great resource to learn from a beginning.",3
25065,"The interviews were great, and useful to see a real experienced designer, however the contents in the course were almost nonexistent. The homework was well planed but it depends much more in the student to learn something that the contents exposed in the videos. Tips aren't the same as methodologies and content in character design.",3
25070,It is cool. but it does not give any certificate of completion at the end as other courses do.,3
25079,"I believe that exaggerated the amount of minutes per video and lack of theory, but it was still a good course.",3
25090,I think this course is ok but is a limited version you need to spend a big time researching a lot about all the things to understand well the purpose and the final project.,3
25091,Not enough guidance for final project.,3
25092,The content of the course is not explained clearly,3
25100,"Galaxy seems to me out of date. There are some useful information, however there are also some drawbacks, especially not clear criteria of assessment of final project .",3
25121,"The final project is the real challenge, the course lectures are just and introduction and you learn the hard way with the project.",3
25126,Course project is difficult for someone who have little idea about the steps in pipelines. Could have included a video that explains few commonly used pipelines and ask the participants to do a project based on it.,3
25156,Some points were technical making a key understanding of how to present a resume,3
25169,Genearlly it helps but I hope it would be much better if you have chances to review resume from each other and receive feedback. Thank you.,3
25172,This course does not allow us to answer the assignments without purchasing the course instead they should allow us to do so.,3
25174,"Some really good pointers. I would have liked to see more for the experienced person, this was quite focused on new college grads.",3
25194,Well organized lectures but the documentation is full of errors. This in combination with the lack of response on the a lack of responsiveness on the forums might make this class frustrating for some.,3
25208,"Pros: Information is perfect for anyone looking at Business Intelligence as a career field, or already in the career field itself. I found the first week to challenge my on-the-job knowledge of a fuller set of concepts and general terminology.Cons: The wording on the quiz questions, in some cases, seems much different than the PPT slides and the instructor's language. UPDATE: The wording is a significant challenge, even when advancing into the more complex topics. I have had many differences of opinions on the solutions based on wording in the requirements.",3
25217,This course needs a cleanup of loose ends on some of the assignments. Some assignment requirements are very ambiguous and in some cases the solutions are not matching the requirements of what was due.,3
25221,Real world data warehouse integrations are more complex than just inner joining the tables to drop those rows not found in the original tables. i wish more complex scenarios are covered.,3
25226,Good for Beginners to go for.,3
25236,Missing course material about how calculating fact table size ans sparsity,3
25247,"The course is well structured and remains focused on the topic on hand. It is easy to follow Kevins thought, but the discussion is quite superficial; no concrete numbers and examples are worked through in the discussion. It would have strengthened the course if the discussion went step-by-step through a balance sheet of one of the companies featured in the course.",3
25248,"Easy to comprehend but far too basic to be helpful and I don't feel I received an ""Understanding of financial statements"" because the course was too rudimentary.",3
25270,"This course is extremely basic. It took me about four hours to complete the entire course (minus the peer reviewed assignment since I audited). This wouldn't be an issue in and of itself, but there were quite a number of issues with the presentation, from questions appearing in the wrong video, to badly worded and misleading questions. It's as if the course material was quickly thrown together and not reviewed or tested. Overall, there is some good info in it if you have no background in accounting and no idea what a balance sheet is, but if you're looking for insight into interpreting balance sheets, this is not the class for you.",3
25329,"The course was useful in providing an introduction to the basics of game theory.However it would benefit from a native English proofread and smoother delivery.There were also problems throughout regarding the display of graphics and notes behind the professor, who kept pointing to something other than he was referring to.A couple of math notations were also incorrect, for example ""<"" when the professor said ""less than or equal to"".Overall though, I'm pleased that I took the course and I learned several important aspects of the topic that will benefit me in future study.",3
25338,"While the subject is interesting, the professor sometimes makes it confusing and dense to understand the basic ideas.Maybe this course does need a mathematic or economic background...",3
25342,good to begin with!,3
25357,Video Orientation is not proper.,3
25371,"This course was mostly working on the same document, and refining it for six weeks. I kind of wanted a little more from the class beside extended peer review time. I thoroughly enjoyed the rest of the specialization's courses, but I didn't think this one was quite up to the same caliber.",3
25378,"The material is very interesting, but the course goes very fast, and the presentation is dry.",3
25394,"Very interesting, but I found it a little bit confusing.",3
25403,"This course as much content in it and it's difficult to have an holistic idea how it all fits together. Some videos are taught having the same problem like, for example, some tools/themes are presented without us knowing what they are for. E.g., Chi-squared test and null hypothesis. Only after a while we understand their use. This bring a lot of overhead to us who are learning.Some videos seem to have been re-worked over time and present cuts or jumps.As for assignments, they should be better worked because some questions are not clear or misleading regarding the criteria that you want to evaluate.For example, I already reported that in Question 2. and 3. of the assignment for the 3rd week. The example you give is a short introduction with two problems: 1) ""I did the website"", which can make the participant not to be at ease to criticize and 2) we're no evaluating the participant performance but the website. Next, you ask us to rewrite the introduction, which we do with those two problems in mind. Now, when we do the peer review we realize that you're expecting for us to rate the new introduction based on having ""early prototype"" and ""user feedback"". The original problems just seem not to count. Only by chance you can eventually write the new introduction touching the points that count for grading.",3
25409,Several errors in lecture and lack-luster assignments decreased my perception of value.,3
25415,"It was a good course overall, but some of the material was very complex and would require more than 3 weeks of study. I am not sure whether it will be useful in a real life, especially calculating Chi-squared and such. I also wish the professor would simplify the language in which he speaks in the lectures.",3
25421,Slow review process (can be).,3
25427,"If you don't pay the fee to get the certification, you can't do the assignments :(",3
25428,I didn't like the way contents were organized. It was too much information in a very short time.,3
25431,"Definitely improved from the first course of this specification. Better feedback on errors regarding quizzes' questions and still really interesting assignments for peer review that help you to learn. Still missing a document or a file with all the notes that one can take away and use as a reference guide, hence only 3/5.",3
25480,"Great Instructor videos, bad assignments and peer grading system.""Is the file submitted as PDF? Rate from 1 to 5"" everyone puts 1 as my score even if I submitted it as PDF file, should be a yes or no question.",3
25488,The course touched just the basics of game design principles. Everything was mostly theory based without any practical examples. I was expecting some kind of other approach of teaching this kind of topic.,3
25491,"The course is interesting.The peer-review assigment and grading system is the weak park of this course : you are asked to do a prototype in one week that must be reviewed ""pretty epic"" from the other students for the highest grade.",3
25493,"I found that the momentum build in the first course of the ""Game Design and Development"" specialization was lost when going into Principles of Game Design. In my opinion the course became too focused on the theory, where it could have combined the learnings of ""Introduction to Game Development"" with the principles of game design in a 50/50 ish combination.However, if your sole purpose is the theory of games and game design, and you do attend the course in relation to the specialization, then by all means, it's a decent course.",3
25495,"Could have more information about concepts. I would say this is a very, very high level look at game design. Concepts are not explored very much. For example, level design is mentioned. I can sum up the whole lesson in that as ""Game designers create pieces and level designers put those pieces together in interesting ways."" How to actually do level design, what makes a good level, etc. are not explored at all. There are some generic tips, like (""Make sure it is balanced,"" ""it should be interesting and paced right."" The most value of this course is the documentation to write down game ideas in.This should all make sense by the fact that the course alone is 4 weeks long. 1 week of the machine learning course is about equal to this whole course.",3
25504,"The course covers a lot of interesting topics i a short time, citing external documents, webpages and books; sometimes some questions in the quiz refer to external documents.About the assignment: it start quite easy, about high concept, story bible, game design document, making the student write more and more detailed, focusing all the attention on the documents. Than, at week4, you need to create a prototype, digital or non-digital, based on your creations. I found this unexpected and really it's unrealistic to be able to create a decent prototype in the same amount of time given to write a document.About the grading system: to take the best score, you need to go ""epicly"" beyond the call of duty. I don't like that. A student should take the maximum score if he does everything required, and he/she does it good. No need to overdo in my opinion.About the quiz: if you make mistakes, he doesn't tell you what's wrong, he doesn't show you the right answer. It's not a problem of the Coursera platform, as in the previous course, the teacher filled the quiz with all the explaination of the correct and incorrect answers.So, should i suggest this course? Well the topics are interesting, they could have been transmitted better, with better assignments and grading score.",3
25510,Nice abstraction about all kinds of games not about a specific game genre. But I'm not into it because I like developing games more than thinking about design. This course's homework is somewhat irrelevant of the course content.,3
25519,"This seemed like a somewhat outdated course but did have a lot of basic info for people who want to make a game but haven't given it much thought. I also found the quizzes and review options frustration due to poorly worded questions and rating choices, as well as the lack of a written feedback option besides comments. Some of the videos seem to kind of drag on a bit as well, but overall it was still helpful for developing my game despite feeling like I didn't gain much new information.",3
25523,"The quizzes were too short to be effective, and without requiring written feedback from peer review, the process doesn't seem very useful. The best information was from the articles and books he recommends.",3
25563,"Tasks are different in complexity, but time is given the same.Speaker's constantly interrupts sentences. Hard to understand for people, who bad speek English.Questions for peer review are bad:""Mark 5 if work amasing"". But we just student, our work are rough, not amasing. And everybody can grade as he wish.",3
25567,Sometimes it was difficult to follow! but good overall,3
25576,Didn't learn as much as intro to game dev'.,3
25579,"One big user-experience comment is that I wish that the videos had been edited; there are many long pauses and times where there is a lot of talking around the thing that you actually want to say. I think you have some great things to say, but perhaps streamlining those ideas and editing out the times when you need to pause to think (which is definitely legitimate when recording yourself!) or other things of that nature, would have definitely cut down on the length of the videos. Long videos aren't bad, if they are well put-together and conveying information in an engaging way.",3
25583,"This was a very wordy course. Some times it felt like they just kept repeating and rambling, but I did learn the proper documentation for big games.",3
25590,"This course has a good starting point, but there are so many things that ended up being wrong that I just can't force myself to give it more than 3 stars (and I'm not sure if it should be 3 or 2 stars). I think this is also the first course on Coursera that didn't get 5 stars from me (not sure if I've given 4 stars once only).So the bad parts first:Assignments are so unrealistic it's unbelievable. Week 1 is doable. Week 2 is problematic if you have a complex idea, let's say it's still doable, but you would certainly need more time than expected weekly hour work. Week 3 is insane. It is so out of the scope of this course. And week 4 is even worse, I had to use pen and paper and then explain only 1 of the core mechanics (even that used more than expected weekly hour work).Some of the quizzes are not fully clear if you are not a native English speaker. Sometimes I had to re-read things several times, and still wasn't sure what I was doing wrong (I realized that only after I managed to literally guess the correct answer).And most of all grading is the worst I've seen in any course. All of it based on a personal opinion. Hey I even managed not to get full points for a ""document is HTML/PDF/...."". I mean - how can I not get full points there? It either is or is not a HTML. It's so much subjective that it's making it awful.Now about the good parts:Professor did a great job, the course inspired so many ideas for me.The material is concise and it was a pleasure listening to this course.Most of the courses are too slow for me, so I have to fast forward them to 1.5 and some even to 2 times speed. I've run this course only on 1.25 speed, which is a good thing. I'm not a native English speaker.",3
25600,"The information is great, but I think they need to make this course in two phases because there was a lot of information to process and the assignments need more time if you want to do a good work. The other part that I didn't like was that the information doesn't really correspond to what you actually need to do for your assignments, I think the course needs more videos and examples of how to create the required documents.",3
25607,"This class started out very rocky and the videos had errors, the quizzes had problems, and the assignments had a poor grading system. Hopefully, these will be corrected in future offerings.",3
25610,"The course material is good, and Casey always gives further reads and references. I specially liked to have book references and I started to read one of those.I found however a disconnection between the idea of using the MDA/DPE framework described in the course, and the actual projects which were more into creating the set of documents used in game design to collect the details, create a better picture, and think better about the game. In some way, the iterative process of coming back to the idea, from document to document, helped to refine the game, but it happened more as something natural.I wished we would have had some sort of checklist to evaluate and apply during the design process the framework.As feedback to the instructor, I think he needs to stop using the ending word ""right?"" to finish his sentences. At some point, of the course it became really difficult to follow, right?. right?. right? ... ufff ...Also, I believe he knows a lot, but a bit of preparation and flow in his lectures would be appreciated. Maybe the use of some sort of autoclue, would help.Last, but this could be more for the course editors, the instructor has good slides and material, but usually during the lectures the slides disappear (just in the moment one need to focus his attention in the written material) and the instructor appears in first plane. I think you could keep the instructor in a PIP box all the time, and perhaps put him in first plane only at the beginning and end.",3
25611,Content is interesting but the lectures and the content is far below the first course in the series in my opinion.,3
25624,"This course competes with a full specialization on Coursera with a slight flavor of the ""Understanding Video Game"" course also available on Coursera.The grading is supported by quizzes and assignment associated to a poor grading system. I found this single class less challenging and interesting than the full specialization on Game Design from CalArts although it allows you to have another view of the process of Game Design in a more engineering way (e.g. writing documentation and not thinking on creating game...).",3
25633,Interesting ideas but a bit disorganized.,3
25635,"Although the course content is highly informative and interesting, the way it's all presented it not the best, most of the time concepts are confusing because of this, quizzes become guessing games most of the time. Forums feel neglected by the course tutor, lot's of question that someone knowledgeable should answer become random rambling as nobody is sure as to what the tutor actually meant. As somebody said on the forums ""I feel like I'm alpha testing your course"".",3
25697,A good start for learning game design and development,3
25754,"3 stars because the lecturer is really good but talks a little bit fast so foreign students cant clearly understand what he means or get ""lost"" in the course. You will say ""you can reduce the speed"" but this would reduce the sound quality too.",3
25784,It's a good start.,3
25858,Very basic introduction. Though it covers all the needed information it lacks of interesting content.,3
25895,"It's a good, but timid, introduction to game development with Unity. It addresses many relevant game development concepts, like programming, collision detection and 3D coordinates. It course may be better appreciated if taken as part of a specialization.",3
25925,"Good for beginners. I am not sure if anyone who has designed even a small game in Unity will be interested in this course. I was quite bored and had to go through all the videos just to complete the assignment which cannot be completed if you don't go through all the videos which I think is the drawback for this course. But again, its for beginners. As for me, I am looking forward to interesting and in-depth topics to learn about. The specialization will hold no value if it doesn't pose any challenge to its pursuers.",3
25939,"Great course, although I would've liked a bit more emphasis on coding.",3
25940,Thanks for your course!,3
26037,"Didactically I was a little disappointed since, as so often, allegedly innovative e-learning is based on a conventional transmission pedagogy, with the instructur delivering frontal-teaching-style lectures and the learner imitating the instructions. As a comparative novice in the field, I'm not sure that I am now able to apply independently what I imitated for the assignments. Scripting went right over my head.Rhetorically, many of the lectures were preformulated written texts rattled off, sometimes quite fast, in spite of the complexity of some of the information. Where the instructor formulated freely, the excessive Uuuhms and ""go ahead's"" nearly drove me bonkers.On the whole, a useful course, though.",3
26049,"While I enjoyed the projects and found the instructor easy to follow and understand, I was disappointed in how little coding we did. The code walkthroughs were rushed and I barely learned enough to scratch the surface of some of the scripts we used in the basic projects. Since scripting is such a huge part of game development, I feel like there should have been more focus on it. Maybe a new term in each video or something?And I understand that the course was only four weeks, which doesn't allow much time for deep scripting analysis, but maybe the course should be longer than four weeks.Overall a fun class and I now have two games to show off to people.",3
26054,I think this course is ok but it is not enough.,3
26067,"The course introduces the student to the production of a game using Unity, but it lacks on programming focus.",3
26210,A little light but still effective course,3
26214,Videos are okay. Content and labs are great minus a issue with one lab where the supplied files were probably designed for a later version.,3
26218,"The final lab had an error that took a long time to find a solution for, which was disappointing. For a paid course, you would expect the labs to be better quality tested.",3
26225,I was expecting more modules on configuration management like deployment manager service.,3
26313,"Good lessons but the issue for me was that some of the video content was a little outdated. For example, it doesn't cover the update version of github website and how to use it. That being said directions sometime can be a little bit confusing. Another thing is some of the instructions are not clear for instance the guidance to how to submit an assignment. It is also intimidating that questions cannot be answered directly and if you want answers you have to dig a little bit dipper to get exactly what you are looking for.",3
26462,"It was a bit fast and some things were not well explained but other than that a great course, love courseera already!",3
26472,It is no that perfect.The instructor focus on explaining what the code do instead of implementing it in the same video.I think the only downside is that he prepare his code and we can't implement the code at the same time because it is already given,3
26574,"Lessons on html and css are very good, better than other coursera classes, so I suggest you to give a look at those. In general, the teacher is very good, even though I found the javascript part less deepen. A week, and partially the last week, are dedicated to the construction of a restaturant site. Unfortunately, the student role is pretty passive: you'll just look the teacher at work, you'll not build a site in this course. I skipped much of those lessons. But the most disappointing point is for me the excessive simplicity of the assignments. The assignments are the primary reason why I decided to take a MOOC instaed of simply reading a book. I expected much (interesting) assignments and much more practice...",3
26906,I like this course it is very easy because of the trainer,3
27235,Very interesting course if you want to have an overview of how climate works. You will understand what we know but most importantly what we do NOT know on the subject. Sadly there was no feedback at all from teachers...,3
27293,Very few topics are covered. Although all the topics that are included are explained very beautifully.,3
27315,"Very good information with a fantastic understanding of the variety of artists. However, I almost dreaded logging in to watch the lectures; they were often boring me to tears. Were this information presented in a more engaging way, this review would be much higher.",3
27318,"Some interesting lessons, yet a rather boring presentation as most faculty were reading their scripts, or seemed nearly jet-lagged in some lessons. Sound recording is sometimes also perfectible (echo due to large museum room).One may also take into consideration that the perspective given in the course is a bit ""Australian-centric"". I should have expected this as the course came from the University of Melbourne, but I have the feeling that some courses on Coursera feel a bit more ""global""...",3
27329,I would prefer the lecture command line notes too in presentations or any other files in each week modules. It was difficult for me to understand her way of teaching and I felt the lectures didn't flow correctly.,3
27337,"It gives a significant coverage of many important command line tools. Teaching level is not good, very difficult to follow.",3
27412,"Good course, but sometimes I missed some supplementary reading material... when I couldn't quite understand something from the videos alone, it would have been nice to read up on a topic.",3
27420,The examples are getting very abstract. It is getting difficult to understand the concepts with the examples explained.,3
27421,The course is very interesting and challenging but there are mistakes in the videos and too much mathematical theory with relation to examples.,3
27423,I think it would be more easy to understand the concepts with more examples,3
27430,Lecturer not conversant with subject.,3
27431,tricky concepts and long equations yet fun,3
27457,"The topic and the class content itself are good, but the introduction is too brief. Hope they can add more stuff!",3
27464,"In my opinion, it gets too technical and it is not a self contained course at all. Neither it is a beginner course for game theory. If someone is looking to understand the real basics of it, should take the Univeristy of Tokyo course. Some lessons were really abstract and I ended up looking for information in other websites to understand it. Another thing... I suppose the three lecturers are incredible good in their respective fields, but in the teaching part, Some Shoham's lessons were like listening to a robot. M. O Jackson is pretty clear in his explanations altough too technical, and Leyton Brown has a very clear way to teach, but I honestly got lost many times in the final exercises.",3
27467,"The games needs to be explained in sufficient details. In addition, after a point in time, it became too technical.",3
27478,In my opinion issues aboard at course are too complex to explained in shorts terms.But the infomation was value enough for an overview approach.Thanks.,3
27479,Basic content that do not explain how business models are applied in digital world,3
27485,"While this topic is interesting, and course goes over some examples. I feel course lacked depth, and didn't really answers main question: how to find business model, or gave case studies of business model. Just reiterated obvious examples, which is common knowledge.Topic : 10/10Quality: 4/10Presentation: 5/10",3
27525,"The first round of the capstone was separated in time by about 6 months from the initial courses, so the lack of additional material was rough. Otherwise the process was a good real word application of NGS processing.",3
27540,good explanation and interesting content. Lessons learned can be put to practice immediately. The content let's you think about starting a business in a general way also. Negative point: the main point are repeted a lot of times. The total number of classes could be reduced (a lot) and still provide the same message,3
27590,This class is very insightful for those interested in pursuing any career having to do with global health or traveling. I am not pursuing a career in this field therefore it didn't entirely appeal to me but Professor Boyd is very passionate and knowledgable at what he does!,3
27686,Rather easy questions and not many difficult ones even in the optional exercises.,3
27790,"I really enjoyed the content and learned a lot but, there were far too many videos that were not functional. In some the video froze, in some the sound went off, in others there were a problem with bot visual and sound. It became increasingly hard to follow the ideas as I had no visuals to support the text.",3
27794,"I FIND THE MATERIAL REALLY GOOD AND EASY TO FOLLOW, THE ASSIGNMENTS ARE VERY HELPFUL TO FULLY UNDERSTAND EACH CHAPTER. I LIKE THAT THERE IS INTERACTION BETWEEN PEERS AND HOW THERE IS FEED BACK FROM EACH OTHER, BUT I DONT LIKE THAT IT IS THE ONLY WAY TO GET AN OPINION, IT DOESNT SEEM TO BE ENOUGH, IF I GET FEEDBACK FROM SOMEONE WHO KNOWS AS LITTLE AS ME OR IS BEGINNING TO EXPLORE GRAPHIC DESIGN, I WOULD HAVE LIKED AN OPINION FROM A PROFESIONAL OR A TEACHER WITH MORE EXPERIENCE. ALSO, AFTER FEEDBACK THERE SHOULD BE A CORRECTION ASSIGNMENT OR A GROWTH OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE THE FEEDBACK AND MAKE YOUR PROJECT BETTER.",3
27795,"A bit basic, but I guess that's what should be expected of an ""Introduction""It would be nice to get a more advanced alternative course",3
27797,Great course to introduce you to basics of graphic design and basic design language.,3
27806,I was expecting to learn to use some tools during the course. Looks like I have to teach myself how to use different programs for designing.,3
27867,"It's very very basic, I know it's considered an introductory course but I expected more. It was very interesting and informative though.",3
27913,"The last assignment caused me CONFUSION. I mean, due to the unclear assignment requirements, we cannot review composition for composition's sake. For example, I did use two squares as the assignment asked, but I changed the transparency of them, so they form a new square when overlapping. And people think I used three squares and thus not following the instructions. And many people used a small circle and a large circle putting at the center vertically to form a scale composition, and you have to give them 3 points because they followed the instructions, but they actually did not do much in terms of composition. Though I got 3.5 scores by two people ( not very bad）, I'm still frustrated, and I hope the assignment requirements could be clearer.",3
27957,Instead of reading blogs and books on graphic design and then following that up with consequent practice I decided to take up this course which would help me do both more efficiently and so far I'm not regretting my decision.,3
27979,Interesting and exploratory but not much was really explained; he just kinda showed examples and said see what I mean. That's great but you're not really learning why and thus in my opinion I don't feel like I learned much about graphic design,3
27995,Thats a good course for beginers.In my opinion should be more illustrative with more real and nice examples.,3
28048,"Overall I think this is a great course and really helpful. However, I had an unpleasant experience on the last week. There is an assignment that asks you to create a single contrast composition of 2 shapes. It says ""shapes"" and still people are not sure if they can use more count of those shapes. I chose to use 2 shapes, but multiple counts and some people that thought this is not only 2 shapes, but 2 counts as well, chose to grade my work with the lowest rating due to unfulfilled assignment. I think this is Coursera`s fault to begin with. They should word their requirements properly so it does not create confusion. Now, we are left to the good will of a classmate to judge our work and people are not even sure what the assignment asks of us exactly.",3
28077,Nice course to understand the basics of graphic design,3
28277,This was a great introductory course to graphic design. It made me think of many ways to represent the same image. I,3
28318,"For what it was, it was a decent course. For some reason I thought it would be a little more advanced. This was a very basic class. Wording of the last assignment limited creativity as it was hard to tell if you had to limit your pictures to 2 shapes,(as in one circle and one square), or 2 shapes(as in as many circles as needed and as many triangles as you needed, but don't add any squares). Reviewing these assignments, because they were so basic, made it hard to offer much in the way of constructive criticism.",3
28337,It is good for beginners only,3
28370,Bit too simple for my liking.,3
28386,"Very basic, but some things are useful, the course is worth it if you are a total newbie",3
28405,"I totally liked the hands-on approach and the nice presentation of the material. On the other hand, I felt a little left alone since there was no didactically planned interaction beyond the peer reviews. Furthermore, a forum for discussion is nice, but it's a little sad if no one can answer course related formal questions, you misinterpret the instructions, and therefore receive a low grade.",3
28471,"The conclusions in the course are not convincing, or at least not presented in a convincing way. I have many doubts about the argument given in the lectures, and I myself can offer many counterexamples and counterarguments. I just cannot believe in Raj's theories when they are so weak and therefore this course will in no way increase my level of happiness.",3
28525,"insightful, inspirational mostly, informative, but gives an impression of a false pep-talks.. the lecturer is very nice but the over-accentuated humor and false bonding with the audience diminishes the overall good feeling of the course",3
28530,"My happiness went down after this course. Only positive thing was that i realized how messed up my life is.Overall its a interesting course, it is obvious that a lot of effort was made while creating it and you can definitely learn something from it",3
28577,"5 star for effort.4 star for content - some of the findings are open to debate but are seemingly portrayed as ""truths""0 star for trying to obtaining personal information (name, email) under the pretext of assignment when such information are not required for completing the assignment.",3
28654,a bit boring,3
28677,I had reached the last session of this course when it suddenly became impossible to access the video. i had to wait several days before this was possible (other videos from other sites were OK so must have been local to you and not a fault at my end) Then when I could access the site again I found I could not reconnect with the course at the level at which I had left it but would have to start again. Unsurprisingly I did not want to do this but would like to finish what was a very interesting and thought provoking course and the presentation was excellent and deserves 6 stars... the prof is a star. I hope you can help in this matter as there does not seem to be anywhere on your site where one has the opportunity to contact Coursera with problems such as this as I do not think this review page is truly relevant to the problem but where else can I go? Please do not suggest the Community Forum.HopefullyMary W,3
28693,"The class was absolutely Wonderful, however I don't have the time to go at a student's pace (work , hom, life in general). I was trying to go back and finish week 6 video #4 but was unable to open the course! I want to llearn I wasn't aware there was a time limit to learn happiness. :(",3
28750,It is a reasonable well-delivered course given the topic,3
28848,That was very informative and motivating course. I wish the quiz was not that detail oriented and hard..,3
28984,"Very good content, oo long, too many words to get to the point, and too many instructions on assignments.",3
29100,"THIS COURSE IS INTERESTING,INFORMATIVE AND USEFFUL. RIGHT NOW I AM HEADING TOWARDS END OF THE COURSE. IT HAS HELPED ME TREMENDOUSLY. I WOULD RECOMEND THIS COURSE FOR EVERYBODY.",3
29129,"Compared to the other courses, this one is kind of boring, but learned some origination of dogs :)",3
29160,"Too many gestures, movements and ahhhs, slides available but not downloadable (what's the point?).",3
29176,"I may have gotten more out of this course if I hadn't already read ""The Genius of Dogs"".I would like to suggest that the slides be subjected to more rigorous proofreading, as I came across several typographical errors. It doesn't look professional.On quizzes, when a student is asked to select the one FALSE answer, please remove any ""all of the above are TRUE"" statements. A mentor replied to another student who pointed out this conumdrum on the Week 7 Forum with: ""I understand where you are coming from Phil, but only one of the answers as an individual answer is incorrect. The answer ""all of the above are correct"" is neither true nor false, as only one of the answers in the 'all' is the exception."" And I say that if I have a bouquet of roses, 11 red ones and 1 yellow and I were to say that ""all of the roses in my bouquet are red"" you would correct me, as one is not, and ""all"" demands 12 out of 12, otherwise, it is not all. Should you still feel a quibble, let me suggest that you contact the Department of Philosophy, ask for someone expert in symbolic logic and run it by him/her.",3
29185,"The course was good, but I think that only it's really enjoyable if you have a dog. As the professor says, both the book and the online resource Dognition isn't needed for the completion of this course. The book was really good, but I think that Dognition was too expensive, especially if you haven't a dog (not useful).",3
29244,"Interesting subject & Basic idea to have a dog defined for the exercises is nice but w/o dog hard to benefit. A bit too much talking in front of a wall ;-) Could benefit from more illustrative material. Graphs / Videos / Pictures. Why not show examples of Dogs doing the games, that would be great for people who do not (yet) own a dog. I was hoping to get some insight into problematic dog behaviour but maybe that was wrong expectation.",3
29248,"Very boring presentation. Far too much 'buy my book/go to MY website'., in it. If he did that in a RT University he would be hauled over the coals. Some interesting points made but most of the information given was from other's research.A little less self-promotion and a little more work, combined with less boring presentation would move it up to 4*",3
29275,"Good information contained within the course which has sparked my interest in continuing to learn and build on my small amount of knowledge. Lower rating than I would usually give for a course because of the way the lectures are delivered. Having a lecturer standing in front of a brick wall, plugging his book and not really connecting with online students was not great. A couple of times during the lectures I dozed off and had to re-run them. If the plugging of own material was removed and the background and tone of voice were altered this could be a captivating and interesting course.",3
29297,"The three stars are because the parts actually giving information had value and I learned some interesting things. The 2 stars were removed because of the truly obnoxious plugging of the prof's own book and research project. He goes on and on about how fantastic it is how we can all participate in scientific research, but if I am SUPPLYING DATA, why do I have to pay for that privilege!? If it were really about the research he would want my data whether I paid for it or not. The course felt mostly like one big plug to make money. To make this course worthwhile you have fast forward a lot through the sales raps, which includes a few lectures in their entirety. It's also much better at twice speed, but most classes are. :)",3
29317,"I did enjoy this course, but at times I felt a little bored, like it was loosing my interest. Some of the information given was more about other species and I think that's what made it less gripping for me.",3
29328,Interesting insights into human interactions with dogs. I just could not finish the entire class.,3
29336,"I enjoyed a lot of this course, especially the parts about evolution and social intelligence. Very interesting!! However, as a professional dog trainer and having studied through the Karen Pryor Academy, I was VERY disappointed to see Brian Hare's misunderstanding of clicker training. I would be happy to chat with him about the realities of clicker training and how an event marker works, if he'd be interested ;)Futhermore, I bought the book and paid for a certificate, but because I took over 180 days to complete the course (despite the course being ""self-paced, with suggested deadlines to help you keep on track), I did not get my certificate and was informed that to get it I'd have to pay again for the same product.",3
29342,"It was a little long before getting to the REALLY interesting stuff, but it's a good course for what you pay. I wish there were a follow up one, like a level 2.I also wish that Brian didn't refer to groups of dogs as ""dog packs"" as dogs are not pack animals. This leads to confusion as dog owners will then believe that they need to be a pack leader and everything that comes with that stereotype. I also wish he didn't focus so much on the idea that dogs are from wolves, because again, many people revert to ""this is how wolves are so this is how i treat my dog"" it leads to confusion. Just read the comments on some threads. Even while doing this course, people were saying how they need to be a pack leader and how they follow what Cesar Milan does.However, for those of us that know there is a difference, it was interesting to learn more about the differences between wolves and dogs. I just wish the course focused more on dogs",3
29343,"Overall, I enjoyed this course, but it gave just a bit too much information on cognitive studies in other species, and it left me still wanting to learn more about dogs. The last 2 weeks were great! The professor was engaging and his work was very interesting, but he said ummm and ahhh so many times that it was a little distracting. The quizzes were good, but some of the questions were worded very oddly so I just couldn't get them right without several attempts. I didn't feel like he covered dog emotion at all. I thought there would be some discussion of facial expressions, the meaning of different tail wags, and the extent of dog emotion (for example, how they grieve and how long they grieve after a loss).",3
29391,I have learnt some basic knowledge about dog's congnition. It may be more interesting if I have a dog to take part in these experments.,3
29477,"Very interesting topic and great instructors.Unfortunately, many things were not covered by video lectures. It often felt like there were parts missing.",3
29478,I very much enjoyed the information contained in the course - however I did find that it was difficult to apply some of the very nuanced biases to the financial problems posed in the quiz when many of the biases were used in examples outside of the stock market in the course readings leading up to the quiz. I really wish there were more examples for each bias (and more from the world of finance) because some biases were really hard to distinguish from one another. On one hand I did like that I wasn't spoon fed the information for the quizes but on the other I don't feel as though I was fully equipped to answer some of the quiz questions due to the way the information had been presented.The information built on itself so I found myself going back to week 1 information and week 2 information in week three.,3
29479,"The first two weeks were great, they were more behavioural economics than behavioural finance specifically. The last week was not up to scratch, readings from the popular press, not experts.",3
29483,The lectures dont cover all the subjects discussed.I would be delighted to listen to lectures about economic bubbles and non rational behavior.,3
29490,"The course information was fairly useful, but the execution not so much. The material spent more time on somewhat repetitive examples than it did on explaining the actual concepts those examples were illustrating, and the videos were primarily just lecturers reading parts of the slides that you had already read, but in their own words.The tests, sadly, were poorly-designed for the subject matter of the course. Behavioral biases - like many psychological phenomena - overlap to some degree, and the frequently-used format of 'choose all that apply' - or worse 'choose all that might apply' - resulted in trying to guess what the test-setter was looking for rather than trying to apply the information that had been learned. When you find yourself trying to decide between the best answer based on what you have learned and a conceptually worse answer that happens to meet the wording of the question - and trying to guess whether the test-setter is looking to prove your understanding or catch you in a mistake - then you start to suspect that the course has been designed more as a way to earn grades than to actually learn.",3
29501,It lacks of video lectures so I had to rely on notes only. The course's content is interesting and has potential to give learner more depth of topics. Hope it will be improved soon.,3
29502,"I think this course is great as an introduction to behavioral finance, however I think the content lacks depth and is rather superficial.",3
29504,"I would have liked this course to be longer, so that the information could have been spread out among more lectures, rather than so much information condensed into one week. It made the exams a little confusing.",3
29515,Excessively short course.,3
29543,It's a good approach to electronics but it doesn't go trough a complete explanation about how we found the formula needed to solve problems.,3
29546,I like this mam teaching,3
29600,The ONLY reason I rated low is because I paid this course and am receiving NO feedback from other students on essays. Very frustrating when you have tried to do your best but get no peer reviews.,3
29604,"It is a good course, but if you want to hand on the assignments, you have to pay. So I am a little disappointed.",3
29693,The course was great and interesting.,3
29695,"The course provides a solid structure on which to build academic essays. The content of the videos is generally good and seems appropriately targeted but the sample essays are disappointingly trivial (and not terribly well written). They seem more suited to young High School students rather than would-be college level writers.The big issue is in the peer assessment process which forms the centre of the practical experience in the course. There is a tremendous time lag apparent between essays being submitted and being reviewed. Mine took between 3 and 4 weeks to get through the process. This is obviously an issue for Coursera to address as it relates to the platform design rather than the course team but it is nevertheless frustrating.There is a big disconnect between the standards the instructors seem to expect and the assignments submitted. The vast majority of students clearly do not have English as a first language and for many writing an academic essay is really some way ahead of their current position. Perhaps more disturbing is that most of the (apparently) native English speakers seem not to have taken any notice of either the lectures or the peer grading rubrics.Despite the shortcomings in the peer review process the material is well presented and offers a strong framework around which students can build good effective essays.Once again, the lack of a forum in this course makes life unnecessarily difficult and frustrating and for me pushes my rating down from a low 4 to 3 stars.",3
29739,"I didn't like this course as much. Mostly because the peer reviews were strict and unforgiving and as an experienced, essay writer, I didn't feel I needed the rigid, boring academic structure required for this assignment. However, I made it through with a decent mark so I'm grateful for it.",3
29740,"There is a problem with the peer reviewing of the assignment. Even you finished all tasks, you need to wait for receiving your grade. For example, I am still waiting for the grade of my assignments, specially I am waiting for more than two weeks for the grading of my assignment in week 2.",3

29803,"Much better than the first course in the specialization.Too many dependencies on non-standard data formats, like MS Word.",3
29824,The course was an interesting way to explore writing models to explore climate change. The way the assignments are written was sometimes confusing.,3
29881,This Course presented some valuable insight into what the public are urged to believe on this controversial epidemic...,3
29900,Some of the videos are labelled wrong and have the wrong subtitles to go along with it. Great information but a bit boring. But really great information.,3
29904,"Quality information and an enjoyable course. I would give it a 4 but there were errors--modules/titles/questions didn't match with some Week 1 content. Additionally, for the grading of the Case Study, there was a section where you could either upload a document or type, then on the peer grading it encouraged you to penalize people for not uploading anything. This negatively effected my grade and the grade I gave to other people.",3
29943,"Course has good breadth and structure, exploring the economic and political side of international energy, however it would be good if a basic technical understanding of energy is incorporated.Some material is rather outdated / inaccessible",3
29966,"This is a very good course to grasp the fundamentals of the various forms of energy.Admin detail: one week between exam-taking after two fails makes no practical sense and is detrimental to the timely completion of the course.The course would also benefit from an actualization, with more analysis of recent economic & political trends:- Oil market has historically been cyclical. Need an analysis of past cycles, and a fresh view on whether the current slump is part of a similar cycle, or a new era?- America's insistence on energy independence, how/why Europe views independence differently, how China/India view their own?- Current Middle-East politics Iraq-Iran-Saudi-Qatar, historical and current role of Saudi Arabia in the OPEC cartel, and the reality and dynamics of spare capacity within OPECStudents should come out of this course with their own view of whether this is the last leg of the fossil fuel race (as hinted by Prof. Lucciani in the COP21 video), or just another bend.",3

30158,"The course is helpful but incomplete. It does not mention dashes and colons. It also misrepresents the usage of semicolons. I have seen the idea of using a semicolon followed by a transition word taught before, but I do not think I have ever seen it done in published writing in my entire life. It strikes me as being pretentious, something to be discouraged.",3

30341,Very good course. Interesting tips and summaries. Very helpful.,3
30432,It's a good course with some interesting resources. Most of the practice resources use Flash and one of the assignment submissions is inconsistent with the other submission formats. The content of the course itself is 4.5 stars. For me there is one element that I wish had an explanation or somewhere to ask about it. Instead I'll need to search the internet for an answer and hope what I find is correct!,3
30457,Some of the lessons aren't clear enough to follow,3
30462,"Review comments:What I learn most form this course is parallel structure and sentence variety lessons in Week 4.[Parallel Structure]It uses some conjunctions like and, but, both....and..., not only...but also...[Sentence Variety]Use the different 4 types English sentence style, simple, compound, complex and compound-complex to enrich your writing. In addition, adverbs, prepositional phrases (like in the morning), other transitions (furthermore) could be used to create variety. At last, combining the short sentences, medium sentences (10-15 words) and long ones (20-40 words) will also make your writing alive. Some other tips will also help like repeating key nouns, using synonyms, saying things in different ways.- Use different sentence types- Start sentence differently- Use different sentence lengths- Use synonyms effectivelyConsidering sentence variety will be the last step when you revise your essay, so do not do it in the begining.",3

This was not clear to me when I joined. And although the content is thorough, it is dull and the assignments uninspiring.If you want to know more about grammar, good (be sure to bone up through, because she assumes a lot about what you might remember from high school and for those of us over 40 ... hmmm).If you want to feel inspired to write something of value and interest to yourself or others, not so good.Over all I would not recommend this course or series of courses. And would suggest seeking out a course that has some kind of proctor or supervisory help available.",3
30595,"I think this is a good review for someone who has the basic in English grammar; however, if you're an ESL student or English-speaking person (who need to start over in grammar).Study first before starting this course.A lot of the feedback in the forum, I found to be poor except when it came from an English-speaking person.You get a lot of: "" OK, Great, etc.."", no real feedback.",3

30693,"It was overall, alright. All of the group assignments killed it for me, though.",3
30704,"Good Course for examining some English Grammar closelyThe course breaks down some aspects of English grammar and punctuation very nicely and has relevant practice exercises.I wish the course covered a slightly wider variety of topics or went into slightly more depth of explanation. The title ""grammar and punctuation"" is misleading in that only a few topics are covered. However, I believe someone learning English or reviewing academic writing would definitely benefit from going through this course. I am a native speaker, and I certainly learned a few things. :)Thank you Professor, TA's and Coursera!",3
30709,"The information was quite was good, but the practice and assignments were too easy. Thanks for providing full explanations and a set of in-video examples for every rule.",3
30712,"it is very nice course, and improve my english writting style",3
30778,helpful.,3
30797,"A solid course for those who require a refresher on certain grammar rules. But, in my opinion, the course should go deeper in the different parts of the English grammar. For example, what are gerunds or infinitives? Still a good course though! I really enjoyed the teacher, as well.",3
30850,A good clear examination of basic punctuation and grammar. The lectures are well presented and the exercises useful. The element which really doesn't work is the peer assessment or review. This seems intended to replace forum discussions but it is not a good substitute (and there are no forums).,3
30930,"The videos are really boring, however the course is good.",3
30992,"This course is helpful and I have learned quite a bit about punctuation and sentence structures.However, while things like tense are important, to be able to differentiate 12 tenses contributes relatively little to typical academic writing. Rather, I have had trouble with seemingly simple questions such as when to use past tense and when to use present tense in a literature review. But these aspects are probably the most useful when it comes to pracital writing. It would be helpful if these issues are addressed.Also, the use of articles is a common weakness for a lot of students (to ""the"" or not to ""the""). It is helpful to include this component too.",3
30993,I had a good time learning new things which are generally not told in your academics.Thanks to UCI for offering it. Best wishes.,3
31057,I think Punctuacion is the main topic,3
31065,"I would have liked some more depth in the course. While the course name says ""punctuation"", it deals only with commas and to a small extent, with semicolons. The assignments and practice exercises need to be tougher. Also, given that this course is taken by students from all over the globe, it should mention that the ""serial comma"" is not mandatory in all writing styles.",3
31132,good way to go back to the basics,3
31142,Short course.Please add more content to it.,3
31199,"This course is well worth a student's time and effort. There are excellent presentations by the professor, but in it's current format the course is too short for the amount of technical knowledge implicit in the material. In addition, the quizzes are poorly written. Some questions are asked at the end of modules when the subject of the question is not even introduced until the following module. Further, for some questions the right answer is either not given in the choices presented or the grading protocol doesn't recognize the correct answer. Some questions ask what answer is ""most correct"" which implies that there is a strong element of subjective judgement involved in its formulation. The student is allowed only one attempt at a quiz every 8 hours, where many other Coursera courses allow 3 attempts every 8 hours, which is more conducive learning and retaining the material due to the instant feedback. Finally, there are several ""NOT"" or 'opposite answer' questions which are valid but confusing, so the student must be careful when answering.Recommendations: 1. Add at least three more sessions to the class and spread the technical material out over more sessions. 2. Rewrite the quiz question set to clarify what you are asking, and make certain the material was covered in the module you are assessing. 3. Don't use 'what is the best answer' (""most correct"") type questions, they are ALL too subjective to be fair. 4. Recheck the grading protocol to make certain it is properly evaluating the answers.",3
31272,"I would make it a 5 but this course will not list on my ""completed courses"" and that annoys me.",3
31309,"Although the information provided by the course is good, I do find it a bit difficult to listen to the videos. In truth, I typically read through the transcripts instead of watching them. I understand the the professor is attempting to provide an interesting and engaging experience, but I end up feeling as though I'm being talked to like I'm a child.",3
31310,"I'm only rating this course 3 stars because it's just too easy. The information is good (what there is of it) and is presented well. It's just that the amount of effort needed to pass is minimal.For example, the fifth week had fewer assignments than the previous weeks, and the six week was only a quick review.The problem I have with these courses being so easy is that online courses already suffer from the widespread view that they're not as valuable as a ""real"" in-person course. So, when yet another one of these online courses is incredibly easy to pass, it only adds fuel to those people's arguments and reduces the overall value of the certificate of completion.I want my certificate to mean something. Please stop watering down these courses! Ditch the pay you pass mentality. Include more material to read. Make the tests longer and more difficult. Because, as they are, they don't even compare in difficulty to the junior college courses, much less the university courses, I've taken in the past.",3
31332,Pretty basic stuff but you have to take it to advance to presumably more interesting material,3
31403,"There was interesting information in the class, but the peer review questions were not well developed to stimulate thought and new ideas. Many of the answers I read were just repetitions of what was learned in class. I think the objectives and expectations could have been more clearly communicated and the statement themselves better thought out. I also did not find the peer review process to be that productive as a grading tool. The parameters for grading were extremely simple and the feed back was quite subjective from students that did not understand the assignments.While I learned some useful information, I won't continue with this course.",3
31464,"There are issues with submitting assignments (failure to process submission in Coursera).Peer reviews may not be the best solution, as we have to wait a long time for our work to be reviewed!",3
31515,"This class is very easy. It is a decent introduction, but has very little content. It is clearly made to be accessible to people from all around the world, and takes the content very slowly. The test questions ask you to recite information from the video lectures and reading, rather than thinking critically. It seems like they are just trying to make sure you watched/read the content and understood it, rather than making sure you acquired the knowledge. I guess it would be hard to grade essay questions in a class this big, but the content could go a little faster.",3
31673,"I would give it 5 stars but , staff really needs to start reviewing assignments because there are a couple of bad apples copying the work of other students. We work hard and should not have our work plagiarized, but since it is peer review and not teacher graded, they get away with it.",3
31740,I thought the course was good although some of the material a bit basic but it definitely will help with my teaching.,3
31763,"The content is great, but the course lacks support from the staff. It is also too easy to pass. I hope the reason for this is because the course was introductory.",3
31814,"It is really a start in the field. If you already have teaching experience you will get much more from the conversations in the forums than from the lectures. And if you have very little teaching experience or are interested in the field, it will give you a clear overview.",3
31856,"This class felt a bit elementary . . . but it had some good material as well. I would appreciate a bit less overacting and goofiness (which actually praised in the course) and have a bit more academic material. In one of the videos, the professor suggested that teaching should be slightly above the student's level but not too high. This course seemed to be a bit lower than my level (but I have taken education courses in the past).",3
31929,content is good but its not made interesting.,3
31933,"Firstly i think for a coursera course it is not Long enough at all. There are not enough assignments which motivate studying and fixing the newly learned things in the memory. There are neither required nor recommended readings at all. For me reading is a very good Addition to the Videos so that you can slowly think about the thoughts and arguments. Especially in a topic which is undoubtly very controversal in public as in academia like especially the history of Israel and Palestine from the 30s onwards it is important to give different narratives of history to the students. There are no narratives critical to british colonialism at all mentioned, instead of the White paper of 1939. After all the course represents a very one sided an biased narrative which is presented to a global audience of students. Even if a certain narrative is preferred by the teaching scholars, which is completely acceptable and natural, not just in the field of history, it nevertheless is important to cover different narratives fairly and as neutral as possible, which does not happen in this course. When mentioned other narratives are quickly downplayed or denied, and repeatedly dichotomies like the ""inferior"" arabs, the ""ferocity"" of the arab oposition and so on are mentioned or cited without beeing problematized at all. Nevertheless the Course was a reminder of many Things I learned before, and brings up some interesting historic connections and key points.",3
31934,"Good, concise course.The reason I didn't give it a higher rating is because I found it difficult (not impossible) to follow some of professor Eyal Naveh speach. His first language is not English, so I do not expect him to speak perfect English. However, I would expect the subtitles/transcript not to have basic mistakes. This became important when professor Naveb interview another person in Hebrew, as I found I could not really trust the subtitles.I think it wouldn't take much to make it an excellent course.My cheeky suggestion is to have a specialisation with The Emergence of the Modern Middle East by Professor Asher Susser as nucleus and a series of shorter, more in depth courses on certain of the bigger countries, such as Egypt, Turkey and Iran, similar to this one on Israel.",3
31936,"Really enjoyed the information and perspective from the course. The only issue is that everything is from the Israeli point of view - the course would benefit from some discussion/inclusion from other perspectives. Still, it gave me a good background on the issues, and I would take more classes from the same institution.",3
31940,"In the end it is a good course. The videos might seem short, but are filled with tons of information. It has guest professors who were very interesting, and I hope they could have give their perspective on the subjects as well.There is no reading material, which is kinda sad. And it's naturally a little partial in favor to jews, but that's only natural. Prof. Susser, though, seems a lot more objective.I thank very much the professors for this course.",3
31983,"Should have talked about how German and other European industries used forced labour for their benefit. Siemens is still involved in lawsuits about this and is on the news now.Please also talk about IBM's involvement in helping Nazi's with punch cards to help organise the millions of jews and other races they murderedArt theft is something thats really interesting that was not touched upon. THe german govt is now providing subsidies to art owners who wish to examine the provenance of the art they own so that it can be returned to the heirs of the rightful ownersInvolvement of Swiss (while being neutral) in banking and financial support to Nazis and exploitation of Jews is something that missing here. Numbered accounts were created to help jews send their money abroad without being detected, but their heirs could never get the money back",3
32025,"This is an amazing, interesting course! I never thought that learning about Hitler and the origins of the Holocaust would become an interest, but it's really great! And the teacher/professor explains it so well!",3
32081,I had a great and much needed introduction.Tiffany B.,3
32138,"I watched all the videos, but did not do the coursework.I was a total beginner on the subject. The videos were very well made, and quite nice to watch.However, I feel like the material was a bit too easy for my taste. I would have enjoyed a course that delved into ""harder things"".For someone who doesn't like as much ""hard challenges"" as I do, I do think that this course is a nice introduction to the subject.",3
32154,Though at a high level but I did like the contents and the deliver format which is easy to understand.,3
32182,"I am from China.I think the courses is easy for a senior high school students. The vidio is too long.it is better to make it short.At all,thank you for your wonderful teaching!",3
32284,"This course is more like a brief to ""how to design and launch a product into the market"" with a case study of an app targeting to aged population. I even felt like I was watching its commercial sometimes.",3
32286,"At the first time it was a very usefull course in terms of knowing how we can improve life quality of this population in particular, but, at the end the course it turned into another perspective that for me does not met all the objectives previously exposed",3
32289,Enjoyed this course less than the other courses in the series. Needs to be refreshed and updated.,3
32298,"Doesn't provide as much of an in-depth info as I was expecting, but its a good course to get you started with hybrid app development.",3
32312,A lot of outdated information. A lot of mistakes. But still a good way to understand the basics.,3
32332,"It´s a very good course, but when we get to the part of really generating the app, I had a lot of problems that were not covered in the course.",3
32353,"Quite comprehensive, entertaining course. Unfortunately, not being able to submit the assignments without paying a fee is rather offputting - Especially taking into account we're talking about peer-to-peer reviews",3
32376,It was a pain installing the necessary tools for this course for me on Linux. Made it a little difficult to keep up.,3
32379,I got the feeling that we ran through the material and did not spend ample time setting up the testing and understanding the environment. Maybe the course need to be two weeks to cover this properly.,3
32389,Fun and useful,3
32427,It was an interesting class though the scale of difficulty was very low. I would improve this course by adding more technicalities.,3
32485,Interesting introduction to the topic. Would be beneficial if the course could be expanded and a formal certificate could be obtained providing credits or official points.,3
32490,"Was an interesting course but, at least to me, seemed to lack relevant material I was hoping for. When Addressing the concepts of Ebola, SARS, or the concepts of anti-vaccination the content was vague. But overall I thought the course was very informative on the concepts of how infections can spread and how we can track the movements in order to help control infection rates. I will definitely be going back to rewatch some of these lectures in the future.",3
32493,"Good course on Infectious diseases; rather broad which includes social and belief perspectives.Good points are: the part on the ""social networks"" which enable the student in better understanding on the patterns of transmission; the part on agriculture and zoonosis and their impact on infections in humans.Parts where I expected a bit more: the part on the ""dynamics"", mostly on the SIR framework (I actually I choose to take this course hoping to get a deeper and practical understanding of this type of modeling).",3
32520,"The exams did not explain why the wrong answers are wrong. Even after you succeed a test, I expect an explanation of the questions, and the correct answers. Even if I have a correct answer to a question, I don't know if my reasoning is correct..",3
32530,I think that the above course was a little bored. I would like something with more practice and less theory.,3
32547,Please put more content. The content is very less.,3
32572,LOVED but wish it would have been more in depth and less of an overview of other services,3
32611,"The primary lecturer is a little boring. She's quite knowledgeable and presents interesting material, however, she could benefit by animating her presentation style a little bit, so it doesn't sound like she's just reading it out loud.",3
32614,This course was rather like conventional classroom teaching in video formats. There was a greater emphasis on programs and practices in the U.S.A. I personally felt the lack of a global perspective on health care informatics practices.,3
32622,"Pleasant voice, clear material....but more basic than I expected. Excellent introduction to Informatics but I have encountered a lot of the material in professional work and reading.",3
32646,I didn't enjoy this course as much as the others. Particularly due to the fact that I am only looking for hands on knowledge on how to develop a game and not create a business around it.,3
32650,This course is too broad and specific to USA.,3
32682,"This course tries to address problems that might arise from game development. It's not an approach to the accounting problems, like finances, a game company may have, but mostly an approach to the bureaucratic problems of creating and publishing a game. It also provides knowledge about monetization pratices and publishing pratices, warning the future game developer how a publish may inadvertently ""throw a wrench in the works"" of game development.",3
32689,"I wasn't that impressed. I did learn a lot about business types and copyright stuff, but it seemed like the assignments had nothing to do with the course material.",3
32691,"Beginner course. Well designed, but not for advanced game developers.",3
32705,"The information in this course was valuable, but the assignments were poorly integrated with the course. The types of documents assigned were either not covered or barely covered in the course leaving the students to guess what was expected. For one assignment the provided template left off a section required in the grading criteria. The quizes were also poorly tied to the lecture material and some of the questions were ambiguous. There were several quizes were a single wrong answer resulted in having to take the quiz over.",3
32714,"This is a good course, but being a professional in the software industry, I know many of the teachings described here. It was still a good refresher to have.",3
32727,Interesting but too theoretic.,3
32790,"repeat of the same material and content in multiple videos, the videos were sourced from too many different places leading to 1) decrease of consistent quality and 2) non sequential / logical teaching (each video does not clearly lead to or build on the next one)",3
32791,"Good. One more written assignment would have been good (the one in week 2 was great), and perhaps more incentives or reminders to use the forum. Some of the reading seemed rather hard going and academic and theoretical, but the course was good as an intro to issues related to public policy, getting to know the keywords used, and showing the systemic shifts in cities over the last 2 decades towards a more multi stakeholder approach for a more decarbonated economy.",3
32793,"This is an ok introductory course, a compilation of concepts, related to sustainable cities. Mentiones a list of places where one or another practice is implemented. Some educational clips look like they are taken from Youtube or like promo videos for a certain initiative. Some of the ""lecturers"" are just phd students, introducing their research topics. No step-by-step examples of developed cases are shown.",3
32801,Nice but I completed 2nd week before last date...but then also it gave as overdue.. Which is not correct,3
32808,"Could be even more details and demanding in terms of content, overall it is a good introduction to the topic",3
32846,I learned some creative codings in html 5,3
32847,not for ones who can google,3
32862,The organization of the lessons sometimes feels out of place.,3
32933,"The syllabus is nice for three weeks course.But you have missed many more important topics like forms etc.please try to include them in future.Anyways , teaching is good.",3
32952,"I liked the topics. However, i've liked this course to review the concepts of forms and the types associated: radio buttons, combobox, etc.",3
32999,Nothing about new tags and features. It shouldn't be named Introduction to HTML 5. It's just Introduction to HTML.,3
33037,PDF Course (Like a school),3
33083,This course in okay. But if you want to know much more about Html you should take Class on Fullstack Web Development by The Hong Kong university of Science and Technology which I liked more than this. That course is wonderful and interesting too.,3
33107,"I think It's too little amount of material. It is very shame, that there aren't any exercise after each week.",3
33109,"It was an easy entry for HTML5, I wish it was more in depth.",3
33118,"This is a very easy course, i would definitely recommend it to any beginner in HTML.",3
33164,I thought the teacher was going waaay too fast.,3
33264,Very basic,3
33289,"The weakest part of this coursera - are quizes - full of question, which check detailed facts from lecture instead of testing skills",3
33313,"A good introduction in general.However, more practical exercises are required.",3
33327,"While the textbook used in this course provide a lot of useful background to the Internet, it's history and trends...etc All good knowledge. I am not sure it's the best teaching tool for this course. It lacks the structure to build up a solid foundation of HTML. If the course stops here, the text may be a good reference for students to explore on their own. With CSS and javascript later in the series, I felt a stronger (both in depth and coverage) HTML proficiency is needed.",3
33373,"Interesting course, but recommended only for beginners.",3
33413,"While I was disappointed that HTML forms weren't discussed, this course provided very solid information. A lot of slide and code typos were distracting though and it felt like the instructor was talking less to me (and more reading from a hidden screen), which dampened the overall experience a bit. But the way the instructor explained the course material was very approachable and easy for a beginner like me to understand. After taking this course, I feel like I'm one step closer to thoroughly understanding HTML5.",3
33415,Would have liked an exercise between lessons. Would have liked clearer instructions for final assignment.,3
33457,Clear and very interesting. But I don't think this course is adapted for people who never heard about coding.I liked you speak about accessibility and enjoyed making the quizz. Congrats !,3
33487,It's a good start but needs more examples within the course and more projects to work on,3
33491,very simple . assignments are ok. I would prefer it if the assignments would be all applications and programming.,3
33498,"In the past few years I have taken a number of HTML courses and I know the basics quite well. This is a 'beginner's course' but the final coding project was next to impossible to pass. There was a quiz that would allow you to pass the course without having your code correct. Although my code validated before I submitted it , I got it wrong on the quiz three times and it never did go through correctly!!. I did pass the course with a final grade of 94% but I don't feel confident in my coding ability at all. It would be fine if I had received some feedback showing where the problems were. Without it I have no idea what went wrong. Very frustrating.",3
33541,"Great videos. Teacher awesome.But the course needs, in order to be better, more practical activities and i got a little bit upset when I worked hard in final project and later I saw that it´s not necessary at all.....Instead, I should just did a final quiz.",3
33565,A very basic introduction. Good for anyone new to HTML,3
33573,course is too slow and the videos need some corrections,3
33599,"The course probably should be a bit longer to go into more detail on certain things. I have HTML experience, but no HTML5, figured this would be a good beginners course. Felt the final coding assignment was a bit vague as far as instructions and the video. I can use different tags to make the page look similar to the professors layout, and not be exact in what's required.",3
33608,"If you are looking a general HTML Course, this is for you. This provide general knowledge to create simple web pages, some basic HTML tags and a few practices. My expectation was to have a deeper knowledge of HTML5, spend more time reviewing difference between HTML5 version and the last ones but, I didn't get it, this why I'm giving just 3 starts",3
33636,good intro to the very basics. emphasis on good standards.not enough in-depth analysis or practices. maybe for the next upcoming series.,3
33649,I want more practice!!!!,3
33665,"It was good but little bit too fast, and not obvious, i suppose it would be better it was over 6weeks for HTML5 things only.",3
33681,"Decent introduction. The code submission auto-checker is became a game of getting formatting (whitespace, returns etc) to match perfectly vs. actually submitting working code.",3
33688,The class was good. The instructor is great and she is very knowledgeable. I just wish there were more content in the class.,3
33691,It's a good course for introducing students to html. it gives a broad intro but you have to take it slow,3
33734,"The most weak part is automatical grading. When structure and semantics are essential, text inside tag is not, guessing if exists space between elements isn't acceptable as well. Also it's difficult to check when long code snippets should be pasted as plan text in short text field. Better to use file uploading with required snippet. For me also not enough accent was on html 5 features with dedicated examples how use new tags and attributes.",3
33735,"Videos were OK, practice quizzes somewhat helpful. However, the final autograder quiz was extremely temperamental and gave no usable feedback. This resulted in frustration and made what should have been a good experience a very bad one.Updated course to three stars since a change was made to be able to pass the final quiz without needing to pass the autograder submission.",3
33750,"Could be the best course on HTML5, but autograder is a pure nightmare. There's a good chance to fail your final project because of technical issues. So, 5 stars for the content, 0 stars for the autograder, 3 stars as a final mark.",3
33768,"Very excellent course for beginners. Hope that the next courses will be at the same level!Two main problems, though: first, the autograder is very bad, should be much more flexible.Second, in my opinion, the homework should be more code-based, just like the final project.",3
33785,"Comparing to ""Learn HTML5 from W3C"" from edx this course is fairly weak.",3
33790,Hate auto grading. Overall good basic course.,3
33811,"This course should be a 5 Star course. It is challenging and requires effort. The lectures are well done but not up to the level of the quizzes. The book looks like an abandoned project. The errors and missed references to tables and equations from part one of the book to the other are too many.Having said that, I have never learned so much about a topic. I attempted the problems in the book before I took the quiz. That makes a huge difference. A week covers 2-3 chapters in the book. I started to doing the each chapter's problems before moving on in the week. This made taking the quizzes a lot easier.Overall I am very happy for having taken this course.",3
33848,"Pretty weak teaching - ""maybe you can place objects in this order, or maybe in this order"". No any clear logics.",3
33863,Would have liked to have more assignments and content on imagemaking rather than a focus on making a book. I feel like I got just as much imagemaking experience from the intro to graphic design course offered by Cal Arts.,3
33866,"If you've completed the first course in this specialization, then this is a repeat of a lot of the same information. I didn't find the teaching style very effective either, though it may work better for others.",3
33877,"I like the content and enjoyed the process but as this is online course, it should be better designed. The criteria for reviews and assignment direction is probably not too explicit that cause a lot of confusion, and people are submitting very different assignments from one another. It is not easy to grade and hard to understand what is expected. Also it is recommended that you know Adobe Illustrator or InDesign. I actually had to take additional course alongside of this course because although it was not mandatory, it was better to know how to use these software.",3
33890,"The course content was good but the assignments weren't structured that well. While reviewing I realised some people made very simplistic stuff like me after following instructions, while others with more design experience created really amazing stuff. They should have included some advanced example for demo.",3
33905,Fun course but everything was already covered on the Fundamentals Of Graphic Design Course.,3
33908,Good course if you are driven and can teach yourself. I like the instructor's approach. I'm giving 3 stars only because I was looking for something more about techniques..,3
33913,"This course is good, although it repeats a lot from the Fundamentals of Graphic Design.",3
33922,"This course gave a great opportunity to explore one's creativity, with assignments that didn't require us to have skills in particular types of graphic expression. However, I also found that it didn't give me the richness of principles and techniques that I've found in other courses in this sequence. I expect that, for an in-person course, this instructor gives individualized feedback that provides that content. In a peer review situation, the feedback is quite general and so doesn't take up the slack from the lectures. I suggest that Coursera work with the instructor to retain the current content, but produce much richer lectures that have concepts and principles which students can put into practice even after the course ends.",3
33927,"While I did enjoy this course, I found it to be less useful than the first two in the series. I also noticed a lot of repetition from the course before. I think my expectation was to learn more about imagemaking in a digital sense, but I'm still happy overall that I took this course and I can't wait to earn my specialization.",3
33941,Very poor instructions and not enough theory.,3
34036,"The content of the class is very nice. It gives a nice overview on genetics, and it was made accessible to many of us. Also, Mohamed Noor is very enthusiastic, and provides a lot of nice examples to illustrate the course. However, I think some parts of the class were a little bit dizorganized. For instance, I was sometimes confused by the vocabulary or the variable notations which are not always clear.",3
34059,"Different, fun approach. Basic science.",3
34162,"If you have absolutely no foundation of what the basics of business, then this is for you. It's very simple and direct, but make sure to follow this course up with lecture material that goes slightly more in-depth. I recommend U of Penn.",3
34174,Seemed like pretty basic stuff for the cost of the certificate.,3
34177,A good refresher but did not get to know anything new.,3
34182,It was very theorical than pratical,3
34195,"Good introduction, but just that an introduction. As they say a Macro-overview.",3
34199,This course very briefly presents large picture concepts of Entrepreneurship without going into a enough detail to provide any major benefit. I would see this being most useful to a person who had only vague ideas of what entrepreneurship entailed overall. The quizzes seemed to focus more on what was said during the lectures rather than what large scale constructs actually define entrepreneurs or processes overall. i.e. questions focused on sentence construction and ordering in a lecture rather than the overall concepts the sentences themselves were expected to convey.,3
34202,"It is very good at motivating undertake, but need much more to learn how.",3
34214,"Good information. When you compare this course to others available on Coursera, such as UVA Darden's Design Thinking or University of Maryland courses on Entrepreneurship, this course does not have the same level of information, nor was the same care put into completing the course materials. For instance, the last three or so classes were missing, yet it was still possible to take and pass the final review.",3
34223,"Good course on the various Ps, legal needs, technology needs and what it means to be Inc. Lacked details on how you go about running a business .. so lets say I wanted to start a business analysis consulting firm besides getting a business number what else do I need to hire people, earn revenue and run the business profitably.",3
34303,"Good organization and lecture format, but stressfully strict rubrics on the assignments given the peer review structure.",3
34311,Prof is a bit dry and need a new wardrobe.,3
34315,Please unlock solutions in advance of peer reviews so we can grade peer reviews correctly.,3
34319,"Unfortunetly I can only give a 3/5. There were more things that I didn't like and think that should be improved.What I liked: Positive to see Illinois keep presenting specializations on Coursera. The material was ok, with clean presentation style. The case studies is a very positive resource to have in the course to think critically.What I didn't like: The course is excessivelly short, with only 30-40 minutes of videos per module. Previous courses in both specialization - digital marketing and improving videos have at least 1.5 to 3 hours of video materials. A huge gap. Also if I benchmark against the top specializations from Wharton and U. Michigan (Business Foundations, Business Analytics, Leading People and Teams and Finance: Valuation and Investing) all of them pack a 1.5 to 3 hours of video lectures. There is a huge gap. Also I didn't found the quizzes challeging. In a digital world content is king - both in quality and quantity. You have quality, but are missing the quantity. Unfortunetly I see a trend - the other course of the managerial economics specialization also is very short. A minor thing that I also didn't like was the form that the slides were presented. As in previous specializations - in my opinion all of the module slides should be in the readings section in only one document, instead of divided in small pieces per video lecture.I hope that yu accept my critic as constructive because I have liked most of Illinois courses and was very impressed by the quality and extensive set of videos in the Improving Business speciaization.",3
34321,"The course gives a very high level overview of hardware security and does not go into particular details. Understandably, hardware labs are not included in this online course and the only practice is basic boolean and modular algebra.Quality of the media and transcripts can be improved. Sound is very low and noisy in some videos which makes it hard to watch on a mobile device. Some videos seems to be cut of too early and week's 6 videos are out of order, which is annoying.Overall it's an okay overview of the topic for someone who is unlikely to apply it at daily job (e.g. software engineer like myself).",3
34324,"A lot of it wasn't comprehensible. Also, I may have not been well prepared for it. I should have tried to learn of the background required for this course.",3
34336,"The audio can be difficult to understand. Partially because of the Professor's accent and partially because the recording is poor. If you can get past that, it's a good course and the professor knows his stuff.",3
34347,"Some good material overall, but the notes are not correctly formatted, tests are not formatted that well, lessons are not that clearly structured",3
34352,Fairly good for beginner!,3
34380,"Great Course, but much too fast paced",3
34382,rather hard to understand,3
34389,Some interesting ideas but not entirely convinced by the concept of 'humility' in this context. Is it really any more than simple openness to new ideas and the possibility of being wrong. That is not really 'humble'/ Smacks at times of academic pretension. You need to follow carefully what is being said - not a course to do while doing something else!,3
34400,"Generally good, but exercises in Week 3 & 4 have not been proofread and are full of mistakes. Too bad.",3
34420,Level of difficulty low,3
34431,"the resolution of the video is not clear and also audio is not clear, but the contents are good",3
34434,"The course materials are great, but the Excel videos and its background audios are poor, it need update to compare with characters videos.",3
34436,You need basic understanding of Excel to follow the course. The formulas are interesting and,3
34456,"It's a good course with a lot of information. Some of it will be useful going forward, if I can remember it all!However, it's almost too much information for one course, I think it should be 2-3 courses.",3
34460,"The material was useful, and I learned a lot, but some of the specific lessons were presented in a confusing manner and it seemed like there was an overall lack of quality control (typos, missing videos, material presented in a confusing manner). As a PwC employee, I felt that with greater attention to the quality of the materials/lessons, this course could have presented the firm in a better light.More specifically, in those videos where the instructor typed out formulas for the first time, this could have been done more slowly and using magnification. This would make it very obvious how the formulas were being constructed. As it was, I found myself frequently rewinding and squinting at the screen.All that being said, however, I did feel that the course benefited me significantly, and I plan to leverage this knowledge in my work for PwC.",3
34461,"Very interesting and I'm sure it will be very useful for me. I am now able to use vlookup, iferror, subtotal, and more. However, I found the Week2 project a bit confusing even though I was able to solve it. I admit, I took a loot few times at the answers just to get my head around it and to understand the formulas and how to use them. I even used ""evaluate formula"", F2, trace Dependents/Precedents to understand how it has to work.I would advise you to rewrite the question and to make it clearer whats required. Tips are also not needed and misleading. Also during the course itself it would be nice to show us how to combine several formulas into one line - I had a bit of difficulties with that. Lets not forget that if it's pure math we can follow PEMDAS, however when we have text formulas it's a bit confusing. (i.e. why start with iferror and not find/left/right, etc). I would be happy to discuss in further details :)",3
34483,Decent Course for someone not much exposed to Excel. Pretty Basic information but exercises are good and challenging. Could have been better with more practical approach.,3
34495,I learned a lot but there are definitely errors in the course material and a entire missing video. The course needs to be updated.,3
34496,Exercises need to be reviewed and corrected as they contain many typos and inconsistencies in- not at PwC standard!!,3
34498,"The course was great but there were some quality issues; such as incomplete instructions in week 3 quizzes and some errors in numbers. And the formula bars in the videos (i.e. formulas within the spreadsheets) were immensely small and we could not see the formulas therein. Participants raised this several times in the discussion forum but there was no response from the instructors. Though the course content itself was excellent, the rating is because of the issues mentioned. Otherwise the course was great and I would recommend it to others for the knowledge.",3
34499,"Good material, ,but VERY sloppy in MS Excel handouts. Lot's of mistakes which confused the student. Please do better job of QA before posting these documents.",3
34514,It helped me to recollect the some areas of Exc,3
34522,"Interesting approach, but I expected more useful information on gastronomy",3
34543,"Very interesting topic and good presentation. I took the noncredit option and this was the first course I've taken at Coursera (including Duke) that did not allow me to get answers to quizzes I wanted to take (so I stopped taking them and feel I learned less). In lesson 2.7 (I think) where an in-lesson quiz was offered that asked me to choose between A, B, C, or D the visual disappeared so that I was hindered when presented with the questions to answer. A typo (its vs. it's) I noticed in a later lesson graphic (maybe lesson 6 somewhere). Anyway, thanks for the opportunity to learn about my brain and space.",3
34565,that's good,3
34592,"It was an interesting course, and some of the advices that have been given are quite useful. But I suppose it has no great impact on my lifestyle, as I have enough activity already. But for those who have really sedentary way of life is very helpful.",3
34594,"In my opinion, the course is too basic. Many things looks like teaching 5-years old children by serious professors.But the material is given as natural as possible and milestones are clear and understandable.",3
34596,Provides good tips for how to inc,3
34614,"A very basic course, suited for those who are getting started on physical activity.",3
34621,Well done course. I would have hoped for a little more inspiration and diverse practical ideas. I'd also like the course would more specifically envision a great variety of target audiences.The beginnings are good! Room to spice it up!,3
34624,"Not very motivational but nice,",3
34640,"It was ok, rather basic really, but I suppose that is what some people need.",3
34646,"This is a motivational course, but it's not very extensive.",3
34649,"Pros: Really motivating!Cons: Not much real content even for a beginner, too short.",3
34685,I thinks it only happens to me. I found things are a little unorganized for me who doesn't speak English as mother tongue. But the videos and quizzes help me a lot to understand.,3
34689,"Course design is pretty uneven in pace, engagement and expectation setting. The interactive segments could be better. Also, the core content feels like a hodge-podge of different sources thrown together to support the Professor's lexicon.",3
34701,"Quiet good introduction with clear objectives.Some step by step explanations could be shortened because they seem too detailed.A brief introduction to creating your own data could be great and will cover more stepsBy hte way, thanks for this good introduction",3
34785,"The course and the content was great, but the grading process was terrible. Will probably finish the specialization, but wish there was a better way to be graded for the money.",3
34828,"Very well presented. Unfortunately I think the order was a bit strange. We focused on data analysis instead of basics of data generation. In an introductory course I would have liked to see a bit more what different data looks like. Vectors, rasters, etc.Some of us live and work in countries that don't have a lot of data (I'm a South African and I work in Malaysia... California, the Karroo, and Borneo have different amounts of information available). We're not learning GIS to analyse data because we don't have much data available. We're building the data...We spent too much time on rivers/watersheds. I get that hydrology is Nick's field but some us will work with cities, or population, or roads, planning farmlands - a bit of variety would be nice.The data should not be available off the Coursera page - we should have to get it off the internet so we get familiar with public data resources. The websites should have the broadest data - good regardless of what country you're in.",3
34924,This course is a good introduction to Health Informatics and medical standards. I was searching for more information about FHIR but it was great anyway.,3
34933,Great course from a high level overview perspective. I was interested in a more technical course related to FHIR and it's application in the industry.,3
34960,Its a good course for starters. I was looking for more hands on FHIR when i took this course. I would be delighted to join a hands on FHIR course,3
34962,Very informative but at times too technical,3
34973,Inappropriate rating was done for me.,3
34974,Nowhere near as useful as the first two courses. The assignment did not feel particularly relevant to the bulk of the course materials.,3
34994,"Whilst the material in the course is fine (although repetitious in places), the pacing is fairly poor.Ultimately, there are three things covered by this course: a brief overview of remote sensing, hands-on raster classification and hands-on work with Model Builder work (using hydrology as an example framework). These then combine into the final submitted assignment. Many of the remaining lecture topics don't particularly link in to anything you'll be doing and are just ""for interest's sake"". Also, a lot of time is spent on the more intuitive aspects of Model Builder, but little to none is allotted to troubleshooting and the less intuitive aspects (for example, how to incorporate variables throughout a model or other issues with generalising a custom tool built within Model Builder).If taking the course, be aware that the final submitted assignment requires formulating your own research question and unless you're already working in the field, can necessitate a significant amount of literature review for even the given example research questions. The gap in expectations and assistance is more of a chasm.Unless you have the better part of a week free to commit to the course, it is advised that you skip ahead to the final assignment immediately and spread it over the full four weeks, spending the first week formulating the question, the second producing the classified raster and the third the model builder model, including any research necessary for this step. This gives the last week to produce products for submission or continue the work from the third week.Hopefully in upcoming repeat sessions of the course, pacing will be improved, the grading rubric provided before final submission for the sake of transparency and clarity, and a little more guidance and actual feedback available in the forums, which are largely deserted at this point.",3
35043,I expected something a little more faced paced from Berklee. But it was still good.,3
35080,"The course is really basic but the instructor is good. I liked the idea to submit the exercises and count on other students to review it, however, its a little bit annoying the exercises.",3
35122,"The tasks are easy to perform. An advanced course , which also requires scores is needed. The revisions are not made by the tutor.",3
35188,It would have been good to have more assignments using more complex songs and asking for students to try soloing.,3
35234,"About: First Lessons contain some Interface/Questionnaire errors.Hi, I reckon it's a tad too early to rate this course since it is only going to start - but I didn't see another option to contact the Course Administrator other than trough the rating process.When going through the introduction of this course, there were multiple errors in the Quizzes/Q&A's. EG: On a question with 1 correct answer, the solution page would also show the clearly wrong answers as ""correct"" (or ""correct, well done""). There were several examples like this. It was only a bit confusing at start (this is my very first course on Coursera, maybe it's common thing to happen.)There was also no option in these videos to thumb-up or -down vote, or to report a problem, like I had seen on other courses.In my opinion the videos were well spoken and easy to understand, and they included everything one could think of when first considering to start playing the guitar. Only the beginning of the first video had a slight feeling of ""Ok, I'm a bit annoyed to do this now"" but that could easily be a misinterpretation or a strategy to capture interest. ;-)I do believe it's a good thing that T. shows all the possible extra's one can buy for a guitar, half of which no guitar player I know owns and which, all together would cost almost as much a beginner guitar, but I believe he omitted that guitar strings generally live longer when you clean the strings with a cloth where you touched them after playing. That's a good maintenance practice if you cannot afford to buy 2 sets of strings every month.Maybe a good addition would be that guitars/instruments can also be rented for relatively cheap, instead of having to spend 500-1000 before even knowing what to look (listen) for when buying a guitar.To me the questions until now were a bit too easy but that's Ok. I might be studying with people half my age so that's fine. Especially the first questions should not be frightening but at least tickle your brain ""a little bit"" instead of just repeating a word from the video.Thank you very much for your consideration. I look forward to study with you (all) !Sincerely, Xavier Weydert",3
35244,"Some excellent insights, albeit a bit too superficial in my view. Would have loved to see some concepts explored more in depth",3
35283,"The course is really interesting, but it need a content review. Several - roughly 50% - of the links for external contents, especially when they are from newspapers, are broken.That considered, it was a fascinating journey.",3
35287,"The quizes and tests had trivial answers, almost all could have been answered without watching the videos. More additional resources and a block on adult transgender persons, rather than just a couple of token transgender adults who are Stanford professors, would be nice. The videos were good, especially the ones involving children. The videos with professors were decent but could have been better.",3
35307,"This is a great introductory course for the Health of Transgendered youths. Many intersections such as, socio-economic factors, race, geography, or access issues are not addressed which heavily impact this community and possible families that are disenfranchised by these disparities.",3
35374,relative low efficiency to learn,3
35400,More timely and relevant text material would have greatly helped in broadening our understanding. Basic and easy for beginners to grasp.,3
35401,Good course; but the class do not contributed,3
35408,"Yeah, this course is REALLY different from other MOOCs. I wonder if I can learn anything from a course that contains such little content.",3
35439,It is alright but several people take advantage of the lax review criteria to submit one letter reviews. Better grading system would be good. Material is all fine.,3
35462,"I would love to see this interesting lightweight introduction grow into a solid university level course with more reading, weekly added content, tests, academic discussions and a proactive moderator at the forum.",3
35467,"Interesting online course as introduction with brief concepts and definitions on diplomacy, its role, influence and interaction in the modern world. Recommend others to attend this online course to gain required intro knowledge on diplomacy.",3
35473,It was a great experience! Definitely gained more knowledge about diplomacy.,3
35495,PROSGreat explanations by the instructor. Easy to understand course- with real world examples.CONSPacing was too slow.Too simple and easy for the 5 weeks of coursework in my opinion. Several harder concepts could be covered in the time that the course ran. Problems were also very simple and not very challenging.,3
35603,Quite confusing if you do not have a background already in accounting. The information in the course content does not match up with the quizzes. Great experience but a little lacking on the details needed to pass the quizzes each week....especially week,3
35646,Great content- videos and assignments were fantastic.Little partecipation and interaction with staff and other partecipants makes the course lose a lot of its attractiveness- most of the concepts are not rocket science and one would really benefit from confrontation with other students.,3
35651,"Jumping through the abbreviations, sometimes forgetting to mention what it is at all. Also the second professor was to difficult to u",3
35655,"In my humble opinion it is necessary to review some points in this module:1) Video Content: Making more dynamic, switch between explanations and slides in full screen. Only explanations, it is very tiring to attend the classes. The video would be ideal as shown in week 4 of this Mooc: How the hotel shouldnt work with Expedia? or video: How to hotel shouldnt work with Booking.com?2) Analysis requested: In the first week the requested analysis was of a very high level, it required knowledge of financial analysis and hotel area. In my case, I felt much difficulty because I do not have any knowledge in the hotel industry. And analyzing the exercise, I realized it was necessary to have knowledge of financial ratios of profitability and a certain familiarity in the hotel industry. I left a comment on the discussion board stating that I was not feeling safe to do the exercise. However, there was no demonstration by the teachers of the course.In short, I was not feeling prepared, let alone analyze colleagues. The first time, did not get the minimum score. The second time, with the longest time, I could better perform the exercise. But rather it was the result of review of financial ratios and other other accessories. I realized that those who examined me in the first and second time, had little or no idea about financial analysis. And another point that struck me was that one of the people who fell for me to analyze, was all in white and the person apologized for failing to do. With nothing to analyze, I did not think fair to give a low rating, so I preferred not to analyze. If the person left blank, something needs to be revised.When mounting a course, you have to take into consideration that there are different levels of students: beginner, intermediate and advanced in the subject matter.The first week was not to have been given is analysis. It could have been the third or fourth week of this Mooc, so it would have time for a further deepening of the matter addressed.3) Amount of content: Adding the video, quiz and analysis, are about 30 content. It is very tiring and little time for such content. Could decrease the amount of video and quiz, relocating to another week course or Mooc.4) Feedback: Teachers need to leave a contact way (facebook, twitter, etc.) and be active in Coursera forum or leave a wizard to ask questions when needed.5) Notes: He missed the weight of the notes. I found a little confusing the allocation of notes.6) Curriculum: Missed curriculum (biography) of teachers. No contact information.7) Books: Missed suggestions of books in the hotel industry.Anyway, these are only observed points in order to contribute to development of course. Thanks for listening.",3
35656,this course was not unto the standard i even completed all the assignment i did not pass one and still i got time to redo the assignment and submitted and never got the grade back for it..,3
35669,"Interesting course. But here is the issue, in mini-exams there are very hard questions. I'm passing them anyway but there must not be question those are not described in videos and in original papers. Of course there must be guessing questions too but not too much.",3
35804,I really like the visiting writer seminars -- they were the best part,3
35819,"The Course itself is fun. The videos are enjoyable. The subject matter is great. However the quizzes are way to hard. They ask to many questions with multiple answers and the online student is expected to know so much more materials that is probably taught in the actual class, and does not have access to. For that it becomes frustrating. Especially that the material is not easy to digest.",3
35848,Funny and Intuitive explanations.,3
35877,"Week 4 - too much of materials, and test questions does not match the text",3
35908,The tutoring quality are over the top teaching with well done mentoring and high quality materials. But I felt a lack of coverage of other graphic design of other cultures such as other countries where many ideas were born. ie: Africa and Asia.,3
35915,"The course being concentrated exclusively on the design ideas of United States, it's quite literally ""some ideas from the history of graphic design"". Some of the choices for the contents of the course were, from the continental point of view, rather odd, though that did not make them any less interesting. As a summary: the course was interesting enough to be passed through.",3
35938,Informative and sometimes fascinating.,3
35967,"A nice introductory course.However, I found the latter half of the course too skewed towards the USA.",3
35972,"Very interesting course but also very technical. I'd rather say it is not made for someone who has no basics in 'advanced' mathematics. Nevertheless, I have learnt many useful things and I have now a great outlook on the asset management world.",3
35975,Great course overall. However it does not go deep enough into its topic. Would have been nice to have more challenging excel exercices.,3
35978,"The course topics are great and I have to admit that I learned a lot during this course. The provided materials are good, but in my opinion sometimes not enough to be able to answer some of the questions in the tests. I had to spend some time researching the web to work out some of the problems. This per se is definitely not bad (it rather resembles real life), but all the other courses I have taken on Coursera and other platforms provide enough material and/or explanations to be able to work out all the problems without needing to look it up somewhere else.The problem-solving issue also has to do, to a certain extent, with the formulation both of some questions and answers, which in some cases can be understood in different ways because a key word is missing or is wrong, usually prepositions. I am aware of the fact that the course creators are not native English speakers, but, when formulating questions and answers, they should take the time to check their formulations for grammar and correctness (I am sure there would be no mistakes if the course were in French :) ).I posted a couple of questions on the forums and, sadly, never received an answer. Neither from fellow students, nor from the course moderators. Certainly the fellow students do not have any obligation to reply to questions, and I usually would say the course moderators don't either. But I am paying for this certificate and I therefore expect some kind of support. I am sure the course moderators are very busy and do not have time to be browsing around the question forums every day, but so am I. And taking a look in the forums once a week or so wouldn't hurt. Let me also point out, that the 2 questions I posted are THE ONLY questions in the forums, so it's not as if the moderators would be overwhelmed by the amount of questions posted. After my second question, I knew I was all by myself. From other courses I know that course moderators chime in once in a while on questions that have not been answered by fellow students and when no fellow student seems to be able to find or provide a correct answer.The course is good, and you will learn a lot. If it weren't for the lack of support in the forums, I would give it 4 or maybe even 5 stars, depending on the responses I would receive.Either way, enjoy the course!! I really did, even if it may not sound like it :)",3
35995,Useful. However this course was very complicated and had way too much math for my taste.,3
35998,Course design and objective of the course is good but the assignments were of sub-standard and can be really worked out to be better.,3
36002,"It's more or less a repetition of what you've learned in all the courses, tying four peer-reviewed assignments together into a somewhat contrived ""project"". Not bad, but doesn't really add much value to the courses before.",3
36010,Good general change management strategies as they relate to a complex health care environment,3
36025,"It was good, but I would be happy to see more videos.",3
36049,Too much emphasis on irrelevant fact-repeating (eg date a convention was signed) rather than content and implications of the content for practice.,3
36096,"The scope of the course is really limited, and that is fine for super-introductory courses like this one, but all the emotional attachments aside, looking only into one city's tribunals is questionable from the methodological point of view.",3
36129,Very basic introduction to financial markets.,3
36177,"This has been a wonderful course. It not only equips one with financial knowledge for the corporate world but on a personal level. I believe that through this course, I have placed in a better position to make sound investment decisions. The course is worth repeating",3
36235,A good introduction to finance but it's just a starting point.,3
36238,The lectures were informative. This course is a must if one wants to understand the reasoning behind the creation of certain institutions and instruments. The quizzes were dull and basic stuff. They were just kept to test the attentiveness of the student during the lecture.,3
36296,The questions asked in the tests could have been better. Design questions based on application rather than memory.,3
36341,"The lectures are often superfluous and the professor keeps jumping from subject to subject. From the mathematical side, the course is also rather shallow. Half of the first week quiz verifies knowledge that in my opinion has no practical importance (not something to remember).",3
36388,Robert Schiller has given a good start to understand financial markets which the course provided are informative. Coursera is a great place to learn different subjects without borders.,3
36435,It looks like a (notsogood) synthetis of the course available on Yale website,3
36452,"Due to the course having been compiled from Prof. Shiller's regular lectures and short videos added later specifically for Coursera, the course in overall seems ragged and lacking an encompassing narrative. Chunks of lectures appear missing, with things appearing on the blackboard between the video sequences and several ""previously we talked about X"" when X wasn't mentioned in the online course at all.Disregarding that, it's still a useful and enlightening course.",3
36458,good course and good explanation by Prof.Shiller but a lot of videos were edited like a few parts of the video were deleted. Also I felt like Prof.Shiller sometimes did not explain all the concepts to the full extent which I felt made it a bit difficult for a beginner like me to fully understand what he was teaching,3
36464,"Interesting insights by Professor Shiller, but the course is set at an overly beginners level",3
36474,"The lectures are amazing, but I wish we have a lot more involved homework than the short quizzes. If there were more research questions or problem solving homeworks that demonstrate deeply the understanding of the subjects that would have been great. The current quizzes are very trivial and doesn't test the understanding of the material only the fact that you actually went through the lectures even if quickly.",3
36482,"Financial Markets provided good information on the landscape of finance, mostly referring to USA. If you're from elsewhere (Canada), this course would not really apply. Some of Robert Shiller's ideas were unclear or lost as he was not the best communicator but his passion for finance was evident. The guest speakers, although high profile, were not the best choices, also because of issues with public speaking and generally getting ideas across. I expected more math involved for a course like this but Shiller rather provided more of a historical account of finance. Overall, it is a course worth taking if you're looking for a good overview of finance, how the industry works and how it became that way.",3
36544,"Content was great and Prof. Shiller is one of the most important economists of his generation. However, the assessments could have been better structured so as to be more challenging and a better diagnostic tool for learners. See the Wharton School Introduction to Corporate Accounting course for an example of well implemented multiple choice exams.",3
36583,"Although Prof. Shiller is a well-known Nobel prize winner, from the first several videos, my study experience is not that good. Prof. Shiller seems not well prepared. It would be more helpful with full use of digital blackboard when talking through the rationales behind finance.",3
36618,Very compressed. But its good to have the main themes and then go deeper in each one with other courses.,3
36627,Average Speakers and material,3
36628,"Overall this class was a good starting point for basics of finance, but coming from an Ivy League school it could stand a bit more polish and professionalism, especially if Yale University expects people to pay for the class and their accreditation.The instructor has an odd speech manner which takes a little bit of time to get used to, but doesn't detract from the material.The tests are not difficult but the questions are often poorly phrased, such as questions that ask you what a certain term of art is while none of the answer choices are descriptions of the term of art and the correct answer is an application of the term that does not actually answer the call to question.Most of the videos are cobbled together excerpts from lectures the professor previously gave. As such they cut out randomly, have issues with the sound volume, and often discuss material that was cut out prior to the section or should come later, but never does. Not the biggest problem once you get used to it, because the course is an overview, but it's still kind of annoying and not very professional compared to other courses available.The instructor is clearly very pro-capitalism, which is a mixed bag. On one hand he's very knowledgable and communicates a lot of really good information. On the other hand he's also very clearly biased bordering on utopic about the benefits of capitalism and glossing over a lot of the down side risks that are inherent in finance. To be clear this criticism is not of the Professor, or to say that down side risk and risk management are not sufficiently discussed, but merely that IMHO the course could benefit from more discussion and material on the negative aspects/ramifications of unfettered capitalism, especially given the large amount of time spent discussing the 2008 recession.All that being said, I learned a lot from this course and found it very interesting and informative. While I have a prior basis in the material that helped, I learned a lot of new things and still came away with a better understanding of finance and the international financial system. I would recommend anyone who wants to expand or create a knowledge basis in finance and financial institutions take this course.",3
36643,"Good course, but the video lectures are incomplete. The audience will benefit from seeing the full lecture videos. They can be found here (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8FB14A2200B87185)",3
36649,"I found this course is not the full lectures of the original. If starting directly from Week 1, it would be difficult to follow. Then I have to search back on other website,say like www. open. 163.com in China to watch the introduction part.",3
36652,Great course to get an introduction into the world of finance and it's multiple faces.,3
36657,"Great professor and good content.The biggest problem with this course is the quizzes: not challenging and requires no critical thinking. I was hoping to come into this course doing quizzes that Prof. Shiller gives his Yale students, but I was completely disappointed.Moreover, there are some technical issues with the videos. A lot of them cut off in the middle and I ended up having to go to Youtube to find the full versions.",3
36672,"This might be a great course for those who don't have any previous background in Finance/Business.The course will give you a very introductory observations about modern finance. Tests are quite simple, more suitable for high school, probably. No math required. That's a nonsense for a finance course, but still.",3
36742,Good insight into marketing analysis and the use of R,3
36756,assignments could have been a little tougher with more emphasis on coding.,3
36815,"Focused a little too much on telephone history, though some was interesting. Perhaps spread out to other modules as short background material.Would have preferred history/overview from Internet age with focus on various protocols/technologies that were introduced (IP, TCP, UDP, MQTT, Thread, Bluetooth, ZigbeeModule 6 made up for its more dynamic and more germane presentation. May be make it the 1st module, with other modules going back for a brief historical overview",3
36816,"In itself interesting content, structure was difficult to follow and the history - in my humble view - was going back too far into the past whereas more recent developments where only touched at the surface, quality of slides was poor.",3
36822,"This course helped me in getting introduced to the IOT space, it is very basic/preliminary in nature but helps in setting up stage/ context for acquiring more knowledge and hands on next sessions of the certification.",3
36823,"The course is fine, but I would give the certificate out for free and charge for the ones that follow in the specialization as an incentive to enroll.",3
36826,The teaching has been concise and to the point which is good but not so good for a few difficult topics. Also I've been experiencing video lag and audio stuttering while streaming the videos so there's that.,3
36836,Not much useful if you want to learn about IOT but helpful if you want to learn historical development that lead to IOT,3
36840,"While the last module of this course is very interesting and kept with the specialization, the first 5 modules are a waste of time for the most part. Why would I want to learn about AT&T for two weeks? The amount of useful concepts introduced in the first 5 modules won't take more than 15 minutes if unnecessary things were removed.",3
36841,Gooed clear presenters. Give a good idea of how connectivity works. Last module was a bit obvious (IoT applications),3
36842,It's a very basic course with little technical overview. The history and story of emergence of internet is described.,3
36843,"pace is slow. so many video in pieces, and lecturers keep saying like"" we will look into more details later"" or introduction again and again. I am studying module 2 now, all small lectures like 1 min or 2 mins, which is very shattered, repetitive and annoying.",3
36851,"It is informative, but there are many basics that were not covered well & there was a lot of information that was not that interesting (like too much history)",3
36853,"Not really technical, but a good overview over the past years and even centuries...",3
36854,Great instructors.Lots of historical references and terminology. I would prefer more details about how stuff actually work - in simple layman's terms.Looking forward to the second course.,3
36872,"The topic was interesting , but most of the questions need to be rewritten.",3
36874,Interesting but very introductory. Don't expect to really learn something significant. Easy course. Accent is hard to understand.,3
36878,i feel this course start is somewhat bored because of teaching is not practical based and better follow udacity website tech for teaching interactively,3
36880,"Introductory, not completely relevant to my goals, could be ommitted. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the delivery of the instructor.",3
36886,"This could probably be better broken into two one week courses ""History of Phone Technology"" and ""Intro to IoT"". Many reviewers say they bail out in first few lectures because content seems too far removed from IoT. I enjoyed the last few lectures with examples of IoT, but could have skipped the rest.",3
36888,"Too much theory and history in the course, no practical applications.",3
36889,Too much focusing on history of telephony and only little focus on IoT.,3
36894,This course is a refresher and provides a High Level overview of IoT and its historyas advertised,3
36895,"While this course is well organized and descriptive, it barely touches the Internet of Things technologies.",3
36897,"Reasonable, but slow to come to the essence.",3
36901,"A lot of background information, most of which I was unfamiliar with. Kind of dragged on, but I think it'll ultimately be helpful in the specialization.",3
36906,"Not what I was expecting as part of the program at all. Being more a visual learner I had a very hard time with how the math was covered in this in the course, I need a slide that is specifically V is XXXX, R is XXXX so I have a reference point and I found with most examples given I was having to go back and forth between multiple items and transcripts to gt what I needed. The other thing that I think would have helped me would have been less presenting and maybe a couple of quizzes for knowledge checks vs the pause and think items that were included. I did like Scott's humor, or at least humor attempts overall and I think a live class with him would be better than video. Additionally I felt that the course was a bit out date already, it was recorded in 2015 and I think I would have liked it more if had only been a year behind vs. a year and a half.",3
36923,Ok up to Module 3. Module 4 very convoluted.,3
36932,Some more information regarding the HTML attributes like area controls would have been good.,3
36940,The course content is very backward and needs to be updated though the quiz and project parts were very good and I enjoyed completing the course.,3
36955,It is too basic.,3
37022,no one is here for review my work,3
37034,this course was super boring and the video lasted so much time,3
37051,"Not really a beginner course. I had to complement this course with other JS open source courses only to realise JS is really huge. Additionally, the course requires prior knowledge about HTML and CSS as well and it does not seem to be up to date with newest language versions such as HTML5 and CSS3",3
37053,JS should be more indepth.,3
37077,the course is very good. Good explanations.there should have been more assessments in between the videos for the topic that is taught.too much is covered at once.,3
37112,"The javascript was very difficult, I could not complete. Def, for someone who has more javascript uner their belt.",3
37119,"The Teacher was great, but I was behind a month just because nobody will grade assigment on week2.",3
37140,I learned many thing in this course. It will be knowledgeable for all the web base students.,3
37165,"Course was very informative and the material was presented efficiently, however there have been some notable advancements on this subject matter which would have been nice to see covered.",3
37200,"the course is great but i have problem with the assignments as they all have to be in parts and i can't get why we only submit last part as if it is right the others is right also, i didn't like the assignments system in this course but the course and the assignments itself were great",3
37227,The videos and presentation are fine.The exercises are quite easy and the main problem of the course is that they are review for other students withput any teacher assuring that is right.,3
37241,"It is pretty an interesting course, especially the practical tasks, but, after all, it is much better for those who already knows the technologies mentioned in the title. The information is given very quickly during the lectures, so it may be not so useful for web development beginners (even regarding possible background in other areas of software development). That is why I recommend that course for those who is looking for a good HTML, CSS, and JS revision, not introduction.",3
37249,A little bit of more information on the course couldn.'t hurt it!,3
37282,"Too easy, please do not repeat the same thing three times, it's just a waste of time and I'm not stupid. It's also too academic and should focus more on how to build real websites.On the bright side, it does give you some basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Instead of this course, I would much more recommend following ""HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Web Developers"" by Yaakov Chaikin from John Hopkins university, it taught me good foundations + tricks and good practices for professional web front end developers.",3
37318,"Seemed very basic at the beginning and then got a lot more involved in the last week. I felt there was a lot of code samples to be pulled from, almost so much so that you barely needed to write javascript. More like copy and paste. Class was really easy. I did learn about some major topics of the DOM structure of HTML, so that was great.",3
37362,Great,3
37450,"Very basic the first week, good introduction the second and awesome after the third. 3 starts represent the median value",3
37467,Great assignments and bad videos.,3
37516,GOOD BUT NOT A FULL COURSE,3
37518,It's not bad but I think the other courses in this specialization are much better,3
37579,Bit basic for me,3
37608,Pretty basic but good,3
37652,Very basic course for those who don't have any basic knowledge,3
37671,clear and good example but limited contents,3
37743,"Very good class, professor is very entertaining. Concepts take into account the latest & greatest of HTML & JS. In general, i think a price of $79 is too high for a MOOC class of 3 weeks duration",3
37789,"Teaches a lot of important stuff, but a bit fast paced for my liking.",3
37808,quick intro of html css & js; but not deep enough to get more pro on it,3
37819,"Great course, maybe with one more week they can cover another js data types or even jquery lib",3
37892,"The course is great for advanced beginners looking for a refresher in html/css and fully dives into JavaScript. If you are not familiar with JavaScript, I would suggest supplementing this course with another JS course or book because the course moves quickly through concepts most programmers have a hard time mastering. Still if you are a total noob, you should take the course anyway, as the projects emphasis use of form validation and object-oriented programming in JavaScript which is important for any new web developer.Due to the lack of support from the instructor and aides in terms of technical issues, grading, and discussion board input, I gave the course a 3 out of 5. My understanding is that Coursera is working with the instructor to take care of these issues though.",3
37969,need more engagement and exercises before every week task,3
37994,I think your home assignments should be more difficult.,3
38055,detailed introduction but I feel sometimes the topic can be a little bit deeper.,3
38066,can be more interesting :),3
38080,more excercises should be added to the course,3
38129,"Overall it's a good intro if you know nothing or very little about those topics.That said, the class is too slow.Homework is too easy and boring. It's all about following very specific (long) instructions - ""put this line of JS here"", ""create a function called Foo"", etc.Grading is done by peers, even though it could be automated. Participation requires running arbitrary JS written by other students.",3
38138,"Structured Course that gives beginner to intermediate level expertise. Short course, so there is not much time to give challenging assignments that would prepare you for a job or industry level skill in this topic. The student enrollment was limited (compared to my other courses on Coursera) and hence the discussion forum was not active. There is no TA or instructor participation in discussion forum; hence my advanced questions in forum (intended to learn beyond the course) went unanswered. You can learn this all on internet, but the instructor nicely covered 3 topics in 3 weeks, which is helpful.",3
38147,"The class has a lot of good information but I felt as though it was a bit disorganized. There were way too many people taking the class but not enough to grade the assignments. On the plus side I was able to switch to another session of the class while keeping all of my progress so hopefully my assignments will get graded this time around and I'll be able to complete the class. If an auto-grader or a way to ensure that everybody who turns in assignments will get those assignments graded back quickly could be implemented this would be a stellar class. Despite it's faults though I would still recommend it as I did learn a fair amount of HTML, CSS and JS quickly. I look forward to additional classes from this university. Thank you for your efforts.",3
38223,Need to explain more topics,3
38255,"There was some really great information presented, but mixed in with tangential and unimportant sources (I don't care about the fashionable aspects of IoT!!)",3
38261,"Some good content however it is too reliant on reading a lot of white papers and articles. Some of the readings are very good, however a number of them are out of date for example 2012 in a space that has already rapidly evolved since then. I would have liked to see more examples of how people are exploring ways to address vulnerabilities and activities for cybersecurity",3
38286,I found the persistent reading of the slides to be a little tedious. A little more interactive activity would have been nice.,3
38317,"Great course but for the amount of content provided and how much was taught this course is certainly overpriced...still a good introductory course, teaching very basic stuff.",3
38443,better than my other courses,3
38447,"As a standard overview, the course is fine. However, the lecturer skirts around or hand waves away controversial or difficult subjects, and he's apparently afraid of offending anyone by getting too close to saying ""fuck"" or ""sex"" even in an academic setting. Additionally, this course won't introduce anyone to forgotten and erased artists of the past - women are largely absent from his history of rock, even though Janis Joplin and The Supremes didn't come out of nowhere. The quizzes are also too heavy on the trivia - ""who published what when"" questions rather than critical thinking questions about why or how.",3
38496,Good cource. However more details should have been better,3
38536,Pretty dry.,3
38548,"Labs are ok, Lectures lack interaction (just slides presentation) and the monotonous tone and long sentences of the presenter makes it hard to understand and difficult to pick out important points. (IMHO)",3
38575,"That was a pretty good introduction on how various systems work, together with a nice practical tutorial. However, the delivery has ENORMOUS potential for improvement... for now it's just slides with an extremely impassive voiceover. There are so many good ways to engage with the learner and yet none of them have been employed here. After doing a great Deep Learning course by Google on another platform, this one was a huge disappointment in that regard.",3
38589,The Teacher is not a communicator.,3
38607,It provides me with exercises to practice but some of the videos explain things awfully or just not at all. Others are good. The discussion boards are helpful. I just wish they didn't talk as much about what something is as opposed to how it works. Many videos often don't show any code or very little which makes understand syntax difficult.,3
38609,if you're a somewhat experienced programmer looking to start and hand on learn how to build apps this course is not for you.,3
38636,Good course. Bad arrangement!,3
38648,Its learning curve is almost vertical.,3
38650,Its a solid java class that has almost 0 android learning. If you are expecting any kind of Android related learning. you will get none this is 100% a java class that just runs in the android environment.,3
38663,Too little detail but nice course as an idea.,3
38677,"Now that I have completed the course I'd like to give some feedback on how I think it was.1. Quizzes are horrible. The fact we get no feedback on incorrect answers is not very helpful. There are only 3 quizzes where I missed just one question but no matter what, I can't get them correct. It would be helpful if there was some explanation why an answer your selected was wrong, a hint or something. Also while some of the quiz answers are obvious from watching the lessons, some are totally not and if someone doesn't have ANY programming experience I think they would find some questions almost impossible to answer. I have a programming background and out of all the quizzes I just missed 1 question on 3 of them, but I've been trying to answer them again, and again, and again and I just can't get them right. If there was feedback after taking a quiz I'm sure it would of helped. For those 3 quizzes, I took them so many times all the other answers are memorized and I just keep trying to get that one right. It's not helpful and then it turns into a ""just keep selecting different things until it's right"" thing instead of understanding it.2. The course says it's for beginners to programming but I beg to differ. I think the way the material is presented and how the assignments are laid out I do not think someone(or not many people) would have gotten through that Week two ascii assignment. I thought they assignments in some cases were harder than the lessons. Maybe it's because they way they were explained in the lessons which brings me to #33. I do not think the instructors use the best/most clear examples to present the material to students. There are many easier examples to teach about looping than showing an Ascii art example. Because not only does the student have to grasp the concept of loops, then also have to think about ascii print logic. I think to someone with no experience would get pretty lost pretty quickly in this course. Some of the things explained in the lessons I would actually look up other videos of other people explaining it to get a clearer picture.4. Some material is not consistent. Like in some assignments the text is wrong, for the Account code example, you never really mention the mOut or the interface the class uses which are in the example files and what to do with them when you write the other constructors (The course goes over this later when talking about the constructors and calling a constructor from another constructor but not that early on when you're working with the Account example files5. It seems this course really isn't fully developed yet and is still going through it's growing painsOverall, I would say there are many other courses that are far better at teaching the basics of Java. For me, since I do have some Java experience and a programming background it wasn't too bad, But I'm thinking of the guy who has never touched a line of code before. I just don't think the course does a good enough job at explaining things to someone like that.I really hope the next courses in the specialization are better organized than this because starting with the next course because the next ones are more important to me than this course was only because of my prior background",3
38681,"The course is nice, lectures is fine.But assignments is a bullshit. The instructions are uncertain, with typos. There is random number used, and you have to do magic with your algorithm in order to match expected output. I strongly dislike it.",3
38682,"I liked the course contents, but in my opinion the slides should be more modern, and the main idea in each lesson should get more highlight, and the ideas to retain too.",3
38687,"Good course in general but it could use more exercises and solutions for those exercises. It could be a great course in futureAlso, sometimes it's confusing like you are asked to download code and write it along with the video but the files already (at least partially) contain the code that you should write and it looks quite different from the video.",3
38706,Actually I like the videos. The school is so dynamic! I love it!Just not that systematic. The structure of this course is kind of loose.,3
38710,The videos are great. The activities are fine. The final activity needs more structure/scaffolding.,3
38719,Longer than expected. You could move more of the content into the third section and balance the time commitment,3
38724,"Content is good, nice details and the labs are great (although you can do these anytime as they are outside of Coursera). The quizzes could be more challenging. Also should you run into any technical difficulties or have a question that is best answered by an instructor you won't find anyone.",3
38728,The videos are very dry and not entirely helpful. The labs are well laid out.,3
38729,"Labs are ok, Lectures lack interaction (just slides presentation) and the monotonous tone and long sentences of the presenter makes it hard to understand and difficult to pick out important points.",3
38744,"It could be much better. The experience is old LMS not MOOC like.. There is lack of peer assignment, forum is silent. Lecture is in boring format/tone (to slow), quizzes are boring (single or multiply choice questions - can be solve by tries and errors, open questions are ambiguous).I like content of this course (I learned few new things), but you have to work on form...",3
38828,"If I could give a half star in addition to the 2 given, I would. This was a great course. However it was hard to understand the professors and some of the language that was then in turn translated wasn't quite clear when some accronyms and definitions were a few words off. The lessons taught were great and the knowledge I acquired was exactly what I was looking for, it was just the accents that were hard to decifer. Thank you for this course. I will most likely still take more from IE Business School, but at least will be prepared for printing out the text of the videos instead of stressing over trying to figure out what was said.",3
38865,It was really basic (but 4 weeks - it`s really short period of time for such topic). I think HTML5 and CSS3 courses were better.,3
38876,"This course is quite challenging for beginners. I tried to do the assignment, the code of the assignment are those that i've never learnt before..i only learnt in the forum. Please review so that learners won't be too stress out..Thanks for your kind attention.",3
38897,"This course is a short introduction to JavaScript. Their is some useful information, that is very very interesting and easy to understand, but it is too little to understand JS.",3
38913,"The course is good, but some gaps of information in the middle of the course. It could be better organized",3
38944,VERY small amount of knowledge,3
38966,Very hard and confusing for the beginner,3
38973,This is a good fundamental course. Colleen is a great teacher and I like her unique teaching style and viewpoint.,3
38977,Very good for course for beginners in javascript. You need to have some familiarity though with programming in general.,3
39047,"The course is well structured and focused on the front-end as is the idea of the whole web design track. However, for a person with no previous knowledge of basic programming, the assignments would be hardly possible to complete or would require far more hours. The course is strictly focused on JS UI and DOM and should be probably preceded by another course covering javascript basics.",3
39072,"While there were many typos in screenshots and code examples, this course has been a tremendous help to me as I reinforced some things I already knew about JavaScript and learned new concepts about the JavaScript language (like coding in events or working with the DOM). I definitely feel like a more confident programmer, even though I do wish the instructor could've explained some things in more detail (like when to use the dot attribute notation over the setAttribute method).",3
39073,"good courser for the beginners, right place to start, and begin where the course ends.THANKS A LOT. especially thanks colleen",3
39096,too short and simple,3
39098,"Very very basic....needed lots of outside referencing to complete. Needs more material about parsing, semantics and syntactically correct language.",3
39099,Good course for beginners to get used to the terms of JavaScript and basic working.Unfortunately it's not as good as the HTML and CSS courses in this specialization. The basics are touched upon but I don't feel confident enough to start JavaScript coding on my own yet. More explanation of the concepts is needed as some things are really difficult to understand and you have to search outside the course to understand them.,3
39105,Greate course for beginners.,3
39109,"Teacher's narrative is pretty clear, easy to follow. good for beginners.But the course content is very simple, somewhat too simple for the course title, it only touches on very very basic of javascript.",3
39115,"The course was really great and understandable, in my point of view it would have been a bit more challenging, but still a great course, especially thank to Colleen and her great approach!!!",3
39155,"Too basic, the tasks are pretty plain, course just scrapes the surface without giving any understanding of working with JS, the course ""HTML,CSS and JS"" by D. Rossiter provides a far better understanding.",3
39172,"Very average this time around, not as design focused as the title of the course leads you to believe.",3
39184,"Week on NSURLSession and CoreData is ok (but compared to other courses on Coursera - so and so). Everything else - not very good. But anyway, quick dive into swift.",3
39185,"Although Parham Aarabi is listed as the professor throughout this specialization, it's a bit of a bait-and-switch. Prof Aarabi is an award-winning professor at U of Toronto, but it turns out he knows little about iOS and has Jack Wu teach most of the material. Jack Wu is probably a heck of a developer but he's a terrible instructor. This class is the best of the three in the specialization because Mike Spears does a pretty good job with the sections he teaches.",3
39187,Content is taught too fast!,3
39191,It was good but i felt the last two weeks like stuffing content. I'd have like to dig deeper into mobile development instead of wasting time in appleTV,3
39192,"once again, brief intro that lacked a lot of how to do it actually, pasting code suddenly wasn't fun at all, but overall, the load was easy to grasp but totally needs more practice",3
39195,"I liked this course, but there were a couple of advanced topics (Core Data, WatchOS/TvOS) that I wish we could have more time to spend on. I feel like there wasn't enough time to complete the assignment as we had in the previous courses.",3
39210,"I'm quite sure you need a quite strong background in maths to be able to really understand this course, it should have more math lessons, or readings about it.",3
39212,Although the course material is very good but what I believe is that Image processing is a course where only theory isn't sufficient. Programming assignments should have been made important and compulsory part of the course instead of just MCQ quizzes.This is the reason why Andrew Ng's Machine learning on coursera appears very engaging. Whatever they teach in theory has to be implemented as part of programming assignments which makes learning experience wonderful.I hope that you will give due importance to programming assignments from next session.,3
39219,"Very tough course, mostly because of the amount of work expected. Learnt a lot but it wasn't fun and the course material needs work in my opinion.",3
39233,"Quite disappointed, I thought we'd have something more structured or at least different from the previous courses.The content is here and good, but I was expecting reviews from pro U.X and not student like the previous courses.The good upgrade though is that we have clear examples of submission before we send ours.",3
39242,Week 4 is very bad!Bad quality of video.Bad speaker.,3
39251,"looks like it has great contents but really hard to finish it , due to video and audio issueIn some lectures , I can't hardly read the blurry syntax and almost impossible to hear",3
39252,"The video quality was so bad, can not see the code clearly. Please update the better video.",3
39269,"While this course, tackled the core problems in dealing with intercultural communication, the videos and case studies were confusing to me.",3
39275,"I am sorry to say, but I think this course helps me little",3
39277,The information is well presented but painfully slow.,3
39282,Very intersting,3
39291,"Not enough face to camera time, in comparison with the other two modules in this course specialization. For me, that made it harder to recall the information effectively. But a very interesting topic.",3
39296,"Lots of application that are discussed within the course have been updated, so the tutorials are not longer relevant. This made it challenging to utilize the applications to the full extent.",3
39305,I understand that it's important to know and get familiar with the tools but in my case I already use hootsuite to share and analyse my content. It was very confusing all the tutorials around the platforms.,3
39322,"Great course. Felt a little salesy at times, with all the monitoring products features (some which wouldn't work due to changes in UI or incompatibility with my computer). But overall a great overview of monitoring software and the importance of understanding your audience.",3
39323,Honestly- I think the first two classes are very boring. The fact that there is a 60 year old man sitting at a table is the antithesis of what this course should be to be honest.,3
39326,more of an ad for all of these software companies rather than being taught anything.,3
39358,"I found the course useful to better ground and assimilate the ideas presented in the first one.But on the other hand, as mentioned by other learners, I do find it a little too much on the commercial side.I did find very interesting to learn to use some of the tools such as Klout. I think that in time, and working in the Social Media department of a company, I would get the chance to see the interest of Lexalytics but I DID NOT understand anything related to Bluemix... I felt it was superfluous in this course.All in all, I did appreciate the course as it made me think more deeply about my goals, but I'm not entirely sure it was worth the €71. I feel it could have been shortened a tad bit and go more to the point.I do look forward to the next course though as I am learning a great deal no matter what :)",3
39365,"It's a very special MOOC since they give great tools but it gets a little bit complicated because at the end, you need a tool that sumarizes rather than teaches you programming. Either way, I believe all the MOOCs are fantastic and necessary. They give great examples!",3
39369,"Some interesting content and great softwares/tools. However this second mooc is a bit too much on the commercial side (including VERY pricey softwares that few of us will ever use I guess). Fortunately, the other moocs of the specialization are much much better!",3
39372,"I would prefer to learn about less SMM tools more in depth, rather then getting to know so many just briefly. Felt a little bit overwhelmed.",3
39374,"I liked this course, but there is room for improvement.For the assignment where you list keywords and hashtags associated with your target audience using Social Mention, the keyword results are only as good as the search term you use. And there was not much guidance on how to determine that search term. For instance, my target market is comprised of sales and marketing managers in corporate and creative environments. What should I search for to find out what they are talking about? I truly don't know. I took a guess and completed the assignment, but it would be helpful to understand the strategy for using social mention successfully.Secondly, the IBM Blue Mix section did not work. I signed up (using my Coursera email) but never received a confirmation email. I checked my spam folder. I created a support ticket through IBM and received support emails, but never got the confirmation email. They re-sent it several times but it never came through. Viewing the discussions, I was not the only one this happened to. And I had stopped watching the videos because I thought I needed that access to finish the course. Getting that straightened out would be a huge improvement.",3
39378,Too much basic stuff about Twitter and how everything works in detail. Could be more advanced.,3
39384,"I found it was very interesting, for sure, but maybe too focused some times. Also, it seems good for listening to twitter, for example, but not other social medias that could be much more interesting in different situations.",3
39394,"I liked the assignment, and the course... for the most part. What I didn't care for was so much time being spent on the IBM BlueMix and other software tutorials. I don't really see the value in those software, and it felt very sales pitch-y. I can't imagine using them in my day to day, so it just felt like a waste of time. But I did like all other aspects of this course, including the Taco Bell insight, as well as the details on Social Mention and the other free web applications that is more pertinent to future social work.",3
39400,I found the monitoring tools a bit difficult to grasp in the time frame.,3
39417,"instructor is just reading out slides hence, it's not that exciting to watch the lectures. Just can read through slides to complete it",3
39421,"Good introduction, but not enough details.",3
39427,The information was useful. Particularly the one regarding AR. Though I believe it was too generic in some issues and too technical in some issues without explaining more or less what was meant (e.g. when talking about the maths behind AR),3
39434,"one AR lecture is 20 minutes, nearly fell asleep...",3
39442,Easy to understand and better with technological knowledge,3
39453,A good introduction! Thanks!,3
39457,good overview of the subject.great for introduction to the domain and understand what and how...migth not be enough if you want to go deep into it,3
39460,"The materials of the course are very good, and the presentation is of high quality.A drawback is the lecturer seams follows too close to the slides, so that he looks like reading the written words only.",3
39472,"It would help if there are case studies, practical examples.",3
39473,"Slide show with good information about the domain, but nothing practical.",3
39474,less interactive,3
39482,"Good Slides, I learned a lot of IoT and AR, specially IoT.Unfortunately, the Professor only reads the slides. I was expecting more from Yonsei University",3
39483,Good introductory information.,3
39486,Very basic,3
39494,"Very informative and helpful. With all due respect, I just want to give some suggestion as a learner. I think the course should include some self study materials for student and every topic should include more information and example. Just reading the slides isn't always helpful. Thanks.",3
39496,+ Very interesting course about emerging technologies; makes one understand the basics of IoT and AR interaction as well as functioning+ No electrical engineering background necessary+ Academic and supportive sources presented at the end of each lesson- Not very entertaining,3
39497,Interesting material produced and comprehensive information but the lecture itself is mostly slide reading,3
39501,course is somewhat efficient because the instructor is keep on reading the slides and nothing more than that!! thats it!,3
39511,I expected a little more from this.,3
39519,"Lots of slides reading, but content is good intro into the field and breaks down the applications real well.",3
39521,Very basic and the guy in the video was just reading out things on slides which made it boring,3
39540,I think the teacher has opportunity areas in terms of keeping the audience engage...,3
39802,It was more historical than I expected. Gave me some new and interesting knowledge especially in security topic.,3
39918,"The teacher is great at performing but the pace of the class is way too fast for me.The assignment is hard.But, hey, that's Berklee.",3
39929,"Very good and simplified instruction. But I think it needs one more week discussion to improve improvisation. Also, grades are usually late.",3
39970,"The material was amazing (thank you!), but for those who audit, being excluded from the discussions and the tests at the end of each unit made for a ""less than"" experience. Please don't call yourself a MOOC if the free content is so different from the paid version. I'd like for my Coursera listed courses to show this as complete (but without the badge or Yale specific recognition) but it shows that I didn't complete the course, didn't meet the deadlines because I can't do (although I can see) the needed assignments. For me, I don't need badges or certificates, but I do like being able to access and do everything within a course. This ""less than"" experience isn't how most Coursera courses work. If the content wasn't so amazing, I would have given even fewer stars.",3
39978,"The basic ideas exposed during the course are interesting and good food for thought. However the course contents practically depend on the film and book by Swimme and Tucker; so at the beginning of the course one is shown the complete film, and over the ensuing weeks a particular book chapter and its corresponding fraction of the film is presented again; the quiz (which is very little demanding) at the end of the week is basically based on those contents. I paid for the certificate since the idea of a ""specialization"" appealed to me, but I am not sure it was worth.",3
39992,Subject matter was well presented except too many stops to push his book.,3
40016,"I wish a more extensive exam was administered. I think it was far too easy to pass. Gives the impression the course was not to be taken seriously, while, quite on the contrary, it was interesting and would deserve much effort.",3
40115,It's okay... but paying for a certificate it's not worth it.,3
40131,excellent course but should be more in depth,3
40145,"The course is a good overall approach to Human-Computer Interaction. It teaches how to do participan observation, interviewing, storyboarding and heuristic evaluation.However, I would say that some of the assignments were too simple in terms of complexity and there was few opportunities to apply the theory in the assignments.In general I found the course useful for people who want to learn more about how understand better customer necessities, for design in general.",3
40175,"I believe there is important to have access to the comments of our peers, I've receive some bad grades and I don't know why. And I think part of the learning process is get to know here I'm falling.",3
40212,Grading by students concept is not 100% accurate. No feedback from teachers. Material is not very easy explained.,3
40228,"Good information and assignment design, but please just have someone on your team go through this. I could list the issues with your lectures, but they're so easy to detect by anyone who is watching them actively. It makes me think that QC isn't a part of your workflow, and worry about the quality of future courses in this specialization.",3
40235,"Good intro - I'm learning a lot. But in the end I feel that this specialization is not focused enough on developing portfolio pieces. One portfolio piece at the end of an 8-month course does not seem adequate to me. So I wish we focused more on developing high fidelity work - in addition to the need-finding, user research, sketches, short weekly assignments. This high fidelity, digital work could even be optional, but I need some guidance on what work to develop and how the overall process should look.Or even being allowed to enroll in the capstone before completing the first 7 sections would be helpful.",3
40238,Prefer more references/examples shown in lectures.,3
40258,"It's a great introductory class, but would like more personal feedback from professionals.",3
40289,The content of this course is good but the production quality of the videos are not vary high.,3
40305,"I like the content of the course.However, there are some remarks I want to share.For one of the asssignments I have to create an accout on Soundcloud. I never used it before and do not understand why I should leave somewhere my personal data if I do not plan to use this service in the future. I assume it as direct manipulation and do not like it at all.",3
40308,"I was inerested about this course, but I couldn't understand enough - the speaker talked too fast and I've lost the main subject trying to understand. Sorry.",3
40345,Its an interesting course.,3
40354,Videos could be bigger and reduce the echo in particular,3
40356,"Great topic and content. But there are several things that make this course cumbersome. It would be better to have a few shorter videos than to have one file of 30 to 60 minutes. Also please do not use hardcoded subtitles in the video, because there already is a option to enable subtitles. The last recommendation is to not mix videos and resources. Use the videos to lecture material, to narrate a story or show clips, but put all the resources (mandatory or optional) on a separate HTML page (as other courses usually do).Thank you for making the history of spaceflight come to live for me!",3

For people growing up with the space race it has a lot of interesting video and written material.But there are a lot of simple errors in the material and the assignments.

Furthermore, it is well supported in scientific evidence as multimedia materials that help to understand the concepts addressed in the course.

40510,"It is a good course & I am grateful for any one you puts effort into making education available. The -2 stars is due to complete absence of moderators leading to a defunct discussion. Also be aware that there are a lot of peer graded assignments. Which I think work well, but do mean more work than a lot of courses. In addition you must pass all tasks, which meant I actually failed the course by getting the second top mark you can get on the last assignment despite passing all the others (a fair bit of work put in),",3
40512,"I worked really hard on this course, but was stymied by a couple of quizzes. If I could not answer one question correctly, it meant I could not answer two or three of the next questions, meaning that I could not pass quiz. With no recourse, I was prevented from passing although my overall percentage of points earned was passing. I would still like to pass, as I feel that I really earned the certificate. I would really like a chance to speak to someone who can help me resolve my questions. My other problem was using one of the models, which I never could master, despite reading the help sites and trying two or more times.",3

I love the math.But these are my personal metrics: A 4-star course has a high level of student collaboration and teaching staff participation, a 5-star course has very responsive teaching staff. I love learning the material but the learning environment is disappointing.As the course progresses to the later weeks, the inconsistency between quizzes and lectures grows. Not greatly but enough to frustrate. Some quiz questions, with multiple choice options with only one correct answer, will not accept any answer. There are a few questions which are not covered in the video lecture (or covered in later weeks). Some answers can be found in the book (but the book supposedly is not required). Some answers can be googled but the answers vary wildly between sources.Mathematical Thinking from Stanford is the gold standard.",3

40759,"I thought all of the information was great but at times the course was just very bland especially in terms of presentation. Also, the title is somewhat misleading and the presumptions that the course creators make about its students assume I am a business guy sitting in an office or a part of some team which makes the activities that you HAVE to do in order to pass the course a bit harder to complete. This is good because if what the activity desn't really apply to your situation it makes good practice to imagine a situation - not soo imaginative the task is incredibly easy - and apply what you've learned. However, as I've said, if what you're being asked to do is harder to apply than the activity in many ways isn't all that practical. I prefer Cumulative tests as well because they assess everything you've learned and whether you've retained the information or not.",3

Unfortunately, the course instructors ignore the all-too-common psychological biases some people have about others based upon race, gender, age, orientation, etc. And near the end of the course, we watch a white man encourage us to use more emotion -- specifically anger. That is a laughable suggestion. There are ample examples of the fact that the anger of white men can be effective when the anger of others is counterproductive.

I have been in other courses in Coursera and have found the input from tutors really reassuring because I am getting expert feedback. If courses like this are to be continuously supported by Coursera clients/students, this kind of feedback is critical. If certificates achieved through Coursera are known to be only peer reviewed, such certificates will not carry weight and be recognised by other organisations/employers.",3

Reason why I rated it 3 stars (only) is that the course was too easy - however I'm a sustainability professional.

41328,"The content was useful and I do feel a foundation is being set.The area where I think the course fell short is on the support we got from mentors or instructors in the forum, basically null - pun intended. There are some points where it's easy to fall into a rabbit hole, like I did. Without support, a simple challenge supposed to take a few minutes can turn into hours, days.",3
41329,"It is overall an ok course. Samiliarly as a programming intro class, IMO, the quality, range from the project design and content originzation, is no where close to the IIPP offered by Rice. I do not enjoy this course as much as I did in IIPP.If you are just interested in getting touch with programming, instead of learning Java like I, go to take IIPP.I think the first week should appear later, probably should be swapped with week 2 or even 3. The first week class was just super confusing without knowing the basic concept like vairable type declearation and the connection between different methods.Good Luck!!!",3

The philosophy of this course is to teach through example problems by explaining and solving them.The exercises are very well designed and reinforce the concepts very well. But, the later exercises might be a bit hard for an absolute beginner. Nevertheless, once you can successfully solve an exercise set, you can be sure that you have mastered the related concepts.By the way, this course uses many custom libraries which actually help in writing interesting programs to solve real life problems. The course resource page with detailed documentations is really helpful.Personally, I enjoyed the course. If you have some basic programming skills and want to solve interesting problems, you should give this course a try.",3
41415,I feel like we're left behind by the teachers of this course. The teaching style does not help in getting the right code to work.,3
41452,Good for novice developers trying to learn Java. Not good for experienced developers trying to learn Java.,3
41458,"The staff of this course is really nice, that's the best part of it. Unfortunately, in my opinion this course is not intended for real beginners. From class one I struggled trying to understand what was going on. This may be because instead of just using a typical ide like eclipse or netbeans, they use bluejay, which works different than the rest of ides. In addition, programs used in the course are pretty confusing (If you know 0 Java). I learned most of the basic concepts (classes, methods) for whole week 1 from a single 15 minute video-course from youtube without all the struggling. As I mentioned this only applies if you are a total newbie, if you already know some Java I think you'll be fine.",3

41499,Great introduction & analysis of concepts,3
41525,"It is a course with lots of information but the delivery is a little weak. It is a presentation with an instructor in the corner but he or she mostly just reads the presentation aloud. There needs to be much more interaction, much more animation and passion, and the use of ""real"" people in a ""real"" environment. I can tell you that my mind wondered constantly because of the lack of passion and interest in the subject being conveyed by the presenter as well as the monotonous delivery. Again, the content is valuable and solid, but that in and of itself does not make for a good course.",3
41532,It gives a brief outline and moves very fast and to create a LivePlan is a paid thing.,3

41583,I really enjoyed this course and have learned so much! I wonder if things could be explained a little bit more in the lectures so you are not asked to do things in the assignments that you have no idea how to implement?,3
41684,Content is not that appreciable in terms of technicalities or theory ; But faculty does teach many good things through examples,3

41715,"A bit of a mess. If you are going in expecting to learn nuances of creating effective wireframes and mockups, you will be disappointed. Assignments are good and thought-provoking, but not clearly written. You will get out of the course what you invest in it. Take your assignments seriously and invest a lot of time, even if you know that you are able to pass with a lesser effort.",3
41717,"Poor video editing. Homework assignments were poorly written making it difficult to know exactly what was being graded. Often times I had to submit a version and redo it after I started working through the grading criteria during peer review.Decent information covered, however I felt like this was more of a course on responsive design than specifically information design.",3
41722,The course is oriented to alumni that have a minimal experience with design concept refreshing and updating know how with interesting information sharing with the classmates. The pratical exercises helps to consolidate technics and expertise.,3
41732,"The structure of the lectures as well as the assignments might need some redesign.In the lecture, I think it might be better to explain the algorithm very clearly without talking about any coding details first, and then have some lectures explaining the code implementation. Right now, the coding implementation and the algorithm explainations are mixed together in a way that is not really easy to digest.However, I really appreciate the solid content of this course. The markov assignment is a actual assignment copied from the CS201 course in Duke. Moreover, it is implemented with even a more sophisticated and better desiged structure. In the CS201, the concept of inheritance is not introduced yet. For all of you who made it to week03 assignment, you can applaud yourselves.Sadly, the assignment design of this course is very disappointing. Despite its rich content, it requires the students to take a long time to adjust some details at some corner of the method to do the quiz question. It is very error prone and tedious. The final quizs need some simplification in the structure or format.Overall, I still recommend people taking this course. Very Good content. Just be prepared for the assignment, it really needs a considerable amount of patience and efforts.",3
41737,"Despite having a strong engineering background, I found this course poorly communicated. The heavy use of technical jargon makes the concepts (which are intended to be simple) over complicated. The predictive text is interesting but simple exercises are needed to clearly teach abstraction and interfaces clearly.",3

41867,"I really enjoyed the last part of the course related to the Gesture Interaction and the practical exercise on third week, but overall I missed much more modern materials to show us.

I feel that the course could've been organized a little better (and if I had it to do over I would check out the Reading a Case very early on in the course.) As a teacher, I am disappointed at the rubric that is given because students are grading each other and may not know what an ""average"" response is I feel that the rubric should be better structured to help give a more objective grade.",3
41995,Handy and Informative,3
42008,Good idea for content and good content except poor support from Moderator. In fact zero support as far as I can see.First time I came across grading done by students - it's highly unreliable and not necessarily fair. It's halfway through the course and 2 out of 3 of my assignments haven't been graded because of other students not doing it.There is a requirement to use Adobe Illustrator which is a real pain if you've never used it before and the timescales are tight - it's a 4 weeks course with weekly assignments. Unsure why there is this endorsement for the Illustrator when there is other good and cheaper software avail. (Affinity designer for instance).,3
42050,You have to use adobe illustrator to make the infographic and I didn't think the course did a good enough job giving the basics for that. I had to do a lot of googling to figure out how to do stuff on my own. All of the assessments are done by the people in the course and I thought people were a little too harsh. If someone is completely new to AI then it is a bit much to expect the infographic to be magazine quality.,3
42055,"I enjoyed this course but I was not satisfied with the assessment.The content kept me engaged and highly motivated. I acquired some very specific and useful skills, which I developed by completing projects on topics of my choosing that were meaningful to me. I really liked Karl's casual and somewhat spontaneous style - this is a breath of fresh air from the video tutorials out there where lecturers are reading from prompts or reciting from memory.The biggest drawback to this course is that it relied completely on peer grading for the assessment (which you have to pay for). I don't think this assessment method was sufficiently designed to reduce the influence of graders who were overly subjective, hadn't sufficiently mastered the content themselves, or were disinterested in putting effort into the peer review. From now on, I will think twice about paying for any course where all of the assessment is based on how my classmates grade me. While peer review can be useful for learning, I don't think it's an accurate assessment tool. Especially if I'm paying to learn from a professional in a field, I'd expect to receive some feedback and assessment from that pro.Another area of improvement is that there were several instances where videos repeated things covered in previous videos. These things could be cleaned up a bit and the course would be more polished.",3
42069,"that's very good, but it could be better if there is a way to pay and get certificate. we are in educational and science word not politic word. I live in I.R.Iran and there is no way to pay.I suggest you to provide some prepaid card for Coursera, that we can use of them, same as ITune gift cards.",3
42073,Difficult and kind of tedious subject. Professor knows his stuff but has a foreign accent. Makes it a little difficult at times.,3
42155,Too much HR and not as engaging as the other courses in the specialization,3
42158,Not many new concepts. Mostly common sense.,3
42172,"I think participation in the forum discussion in this course seems not so active and less of interaction among students. If there are some incentives or some grading can be applied to push people to talk more, it will be a very good learning experience to all.",3
42174,"I was expecting a bit more after the great first course of this specialization. Although I enjoyed week 2 and 3 (would give 5 stars), and walk away with relevant information that I can implement in my work, I found week 1 and week 4 difficult to get through. Long lectures, not always relevant stories, a presentation style that did not speak to me, and a bit slow. Nonetheless, I still learned some interesting concepts and I am looking forward to course 3.",3
42179,"This course gave an overview of hiring and developing talent, but had far fewer actionable takeaways than the first course in the specialization. I found Cheri Alexander's sections to be extremely long-winded, unclear, and redundant. Also, I like the idea of mixing up the assignment format, but creating three movies is a lot to ask for a management course, especially when the same assignment could easily have been done in another format - it felt forced. Also, I found that the order for some lectures seemed off and the flow between instructors was not as seamless as it had been before. For instance, we were asked to create a development plan at the end of a week about hiring and before the week on development.",3
42180,"Quite good in average. Will be better to have always or very often the slides in background. Few presenters were not much interesting. Good examples given, but sometimes I do not see how proposition can be used on daily basis",3
42182,We surely all know that the human power is vital to the develop of any given organization. And an effective talent pipeline would help a lot. But there's not enough practical advices about how in this course.,3
42184,"For some reason, I cannot stand the way Cheri Alexander teach the class. The rest of the teachers of this course deliver the material in a much better way. It feels like if either she reads the notes or do not understand the material. She sugarcoats every word, read it in a monotonous way, smiles a lot. I would prefer someone who feels like actually knowing what he/she says, someone who cut to the chase right away. With Cheri I feel bored. Scott and Maxim are the best.",3
42198,"I enjoyed the course overall, but the HR component/perspective was only somewhat useful. Beware of the final unit (week 4): the takeaways and the final quiz are not well aligned. In the week's final project, though the questions doesn't ask for them, be sure to explain your rationales. When reviewing your peers' work, the points rely on whether you've explained yourself. Cheri Alexander's inclusion of videos felt like filler and the notion of having to create a video as an assignment is time-consuming and ultimately not necessary to our learning. Because I experienced a great course with two of the three professors in Leading Teams, I can only conclude that Professor Alexander designed the final assignment, criteria, and quiz. These components were not clear. Fortunately, my classmates were very supportive and understood the spirit of the assignment. It's a good class, but I enjoyed the first one in this specialization more.",3
42200,"Although the topics were of great interest to me, the videos were not as engaging.",3

42249,"I guess may be good if you've never done introspective exercises before. The quizzes tend to focus on irrelevant details from the videos (probably something to do with the instructors focus on ""observation"" which seems to mean trying to remember all irrelevant details). I'm hoping that as this specialization moves beyond introspection to interacting with others, it will get better.",3
42266,I am a bit disappointed. The main concepts would require more explanation. There are too many requests for essay writting and it sometimes feels an infomercial for the school.,3

42387,"Very basic explanations, maybe will need to make it more thoughtful!",3
42388,"Good overview, but some of the content is just quickly mentioned and not put into practice. Give more room to use in examples, create action, tell stories. Some of the lecturers were just reading down the notes wer already see in front of us and were not finishing their sentences in an engaging way (sometimes they made comments in a very low tone) . Some of the sounds are not good quality (mono - just on one ear)",3
42391,"The 3 last weeks, excellent. But the two first to basic.",3

42410,"Though the content is great, it is kind of messy altogether! At the end Prof. Green strongly invites us to enroll for a degree in his field at the university of Maryland and there wouldn't be any problem with that without the kind of messy feeling that the course leaves you with. When you put both together it awfully seems like the university tried to diversify its communication and that the only objective of the course is that you enroll in a degree. At the same time, the technical issues of some lectures give a relatively bad image of the university of Maryland...Too sad because again, the content in most videos is great... Just reorganize it and put it together with more cohesion. Among other peer reviews would be preferable to the current way of testing...",3
42415,"Content wise this course is excellent, quant finance enthusiasts would love this course. Truth be told this is an insanely difficult MOOC to pass/complete, not because its hard, lets face it, the contents are very advanced and its assumed that students would have background in advanced finance, but the problem lies in the fact that the professor does not explain the topics well enough. The professor might be excellent in this field but simply can't explain well enough, he is mostly reading his notes/slides with a few drawings. Second problem is the notations used in the course is extremely confusing, it makes maths look scary. This could have been a the best MOOC on Coursera but the professor's explanation is simply not upto the mark.",3

The concepts are useful and the facts of the topic are communicated well. However, many of the analogies used are childish and cheesy, I think. Also, the presentation is , awkward and amateur/primitive, imo. These days, there are kids putting out more gracefully performed and highly polish productions than this on Youtube. That makes be believe that it's within the realm of possibility that the caliber of the MOOC be increased significantly.Thanks, for learning how to learn ;)",3

If your background is psychology/cognitive science/neuroscience, then you may not learn a whole lot of new learning techniques in this course.

I did learn a few additional learning tools that I plan to implement. If your background is not from one previously mentioned (or similar), this is a great, easy course that will help you learn in all areas of life and is worth taking, esp. for the small time commitment each week relative to the potential life-long benefits.",3

43458,"This course targets mostly students audience, but not people with the aim of self-development, who passed their academic study long time ago. Therefore, information concerning learning process somehow too much basic, but at the same time can be quite useful if you are not aware of all these facts. What didn't also suit me is a lack of structure and a bit confusing videos explaining different concepts of brain structure and functioning, that seemed too much scientific in the frame of this course. But what really hit my interest is enthralling optional interviews with different scientists and just talented people. They were really motivating and inspiring!",3
43465,"I thought this course will be a bit more helpful, there were some good methods I learned like the pomodoro and other concepts I wan't aware of before. Dr. Terry Sejnowski might be very knowledgeable but he can't read a teleprompter and it makes his videos very hard to focus.Overall it was a good course",3
43500,The course is good enough to learn a few concepts about techniques to improve the learning process. Four hours per week is all you will need to finish it with good grades. Great work!,3
43734,Good course.,3
43818,"This course is way too much concentrate on studies for students, not well correlate with studies for everybody",3
44031,"What was helpful to me was: the discussion on spaced repetition, which boosted my confidence in applications like Duolingo and Memrise, and helped me discover Anki. The pomodoro technique is nice to know about, though I have rarely used it so far. I think I was already at the point where I don't need an actual pomodoro timer to get into that mindset. The best two things I probably got from the course was changing my way of thinking from focusing on product to focusing on process (though not always possible of course), and using recall to test myself on what I know rather than reading things over and over and just hoping it's gone in.What I didn't like about the course was the presentation style, the pace, the content density (very low in my opinion), the irrelevant information, the hand-wavey explanations, and so on. The absolute worst of it was the full recommendation for using analogies but with no attempt on explaining how to make *good* anaologies. This is key. Most analogies I come across are misleading for all aspects of a thing but their very narrow scope, and sometimes the thing itself too (after all, you usually make them when you're first learning about a thing, unless you're teaching) and so without knowing how to make good anaologies while they are good for memory they are on average bad for understanding, and I don't think that can be stressed enough.",3
44158,I've been enrolled to this course for over a year already. I abandoned it after the first couple of classes presented by extremely boring teachers. I wouldn't say that their way to deliver the message about efficient learning is motivating.,3
44159,Good stuff. I learned some useful techniques,3
44174,Very Slow...,3
44354,Ive learning a lot with this course.,3
44670,Accessible introduction to basic learning techniques.,3
44752,"Very interesting and applicable advices. But the theory too ""empirical"" and ""metaphoric"" for my taste, a little more rigor would not hurt!May 2016 - French student",3
44783,It's good till now.,3
44825,I did learn things about the way I think and the way I learn. I am an Anatomy and Physioligy student so I appreciated the information.,3
44857,"Many useful techniques and perspectives in this course!Take this course if: you are looking to learn new techniques to improve your time-efficiency and performance in learningDon't take this course if: you are put off by pseudoscientific assertions (an explanation based on the insula being the ""fear center of the brain"" comes to mind) or interspersion of useful information by neurobiological theories that have no relevance for improving your learning performance",3
44871,"Very basic information, focused strongly on test-taking strategies. Nothing bad here, but not really specifically adapted for lifelong learning. If you're a student and don't feel like you have effective, robust study strategies, check out this course as there are handy tips and tricks and some may be new to you.",3
44951,"The beginning sections of the course were interesting as they were descriptive of some pragmatic approaches towards thinking and learning like the POMODORO technique (excuse me if spelling is wrong). The later portions could have been better although they weren't that bad either. Overall, I learned how to learn!",3
44966,<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>,3
45175,Very interesting but not practical,3
45345,"I liked it, but I felt like they didn't get very in depth about a lot of the topics. It was hard to take notes because there seemed to be a lot of skimming of subjects and jumping around.",3
45349,This is a nice course,3
45414,It is on a very basic level as far as the neuroscience and level of material and for that reason it was not super useful to me.,3
45419,"Various helpful techniques but I did find the course rather boring, especially the multiple-choice questions and all the ""scientific"" facts about the brain. It also seems more geared towards high-school or university students than towards the general public, so maybe I was just not in the target audience.",3
45454,it is good but a lot more citations and examples could be included,3
45468,"Good content, well presented. Just too short, and should provide more content.",3
45476,I learned some interesting Tools about Learning. I would love the course to engage us with more concrete Learning,3
45489,"Very good course, but I did't like how the last week focused on test taking. The course should focus more on 'learning how to learn,' not how to ace a test. In that regard, I felt the course began to be oriented more towards students rather than working adults. Why not spend more time on learning how to think innovatively?",3
45546,"Interesting course and worth doing. Could be completed in a day or two if you're just viewing the videos and answering the quiz.Positives: The content is interesting and it gives you plenty to think about, and a decent grounding to go away and learn more if you decide to.Negatives: First week doesn't add much. The videos are awkwardly delivered and the analogies are a bit contrived.Overall, a good primer before moving onto other courses, as it could plant a few new ideas that will be valuable.",3
45554,"The course is interesting, and packed with some easy to understand, easy to apply techniques. On the other hand, the real theory behind why these techniques work is deliberately omitted from the videos. This creates the feeling of a bit of esoteric knowledge, or, what it is worse, a feeling of trial and error techniques, like the ones anybody can develop on his own... Also the total lack of exercises makes it a little bit boring to follow at times. Overall, a good experience.Quick note of speaking speed: I understand that reading slowly is best sometimes, but Prof. Oakley is EXTREMELY slow, so much so, that I watched the videos at 1.25x and still felt like she was speaking at slightly slower speed than a normal person..",3
45825,"Personally for me who had read about neurology, psychology and human behavior. This course does not build a lot on my formal knowledge. However it would be useful to anyone who is interested in learning and curious about brain facts and psychology of learning.",3
45919,Found 1/5 of the content useful.,3
45976,it had some useful tips on learning how to learn,3
46033,"Interesting, although course content and test questions were very easy.",3
46440,"lots of dry theory, not as practical as I expected",3
46725,"I like the material of the course, the interviews but I think it is pretty strict with the answer(s) the ask for in some of the first assessments.",3
46877,The course is too some extent useful It indeed spreads useful techniques and concepts in learning. One thing I do not like is the testing questions. Some of these questions are poorly designed. Using intuition or commonsense is already enough to solve them.,3
46895,"When the course started it was very interesting. I really enjoyed learning about how the brain functions and how memory works. Barbara Oakly was great.However, towards the end of the course I found that it got boring and not that stimulating. Maybe the parts dedicated to test preparation and studying should have been shorter.",3
46979,"Worth doing, but hardly enough content for 4 weeks.",3
47243,"Very easy, but probably helpful",3
47356,"Nice structure although needed more assignments outside just the quizzes, to get you to use the skills",3
47359,"Good course, very education",3
47385,"Good instruction, but it was a bit too basic - many of these concepts are common sense to most people in college or beyond.",3
47626,"Too slow, too vague, but you can feel the ideas behind have potential.",3
47681,"It is an interesting course, however, it focuses a bit too much on current students and test-taking. Learning is not something that stops after graduation and I would appreciate if the authors gave some attention to those who are already done with school, but do not want to stop acquiring new knowledge.",3
47756,"It gave a few good advices about learning and introduced some noteworthy concepts, but the videos became quite boring and repetetive after a while.",3
47800,"There were some interesting insights coinciding with my own experience of learning (I have learnt 8 languages by myself). Particularly the part about chunking was a really good one. On the other hand, Week 4 focusing on how to pass a test in my opinion jumbled the previous material up - passing a test doesn't mean knowledge, it means ability to pass a test. Half of the questions used in the final Quiz shows that this course itself has tried not to develop chunks they were recommending but to make students memorize the content of the video without checking whether or not the content was actually understood and ""chunked"" into real knowledge.So, a better name for this course would be ""Learning how to learn academically"". As for me, I appreciate non-academical knowledge. Kids master their native language without getting the ability to teach it - and this is the true knowledge even though in the farewell video prof. Sejnowski equalized the ability to teach to the knowledge.",3
47803,not very useful,3
47868,"This is a decent course if you are looking for some very general guidelines and concepts about how your brain works to learn things. I find it rather vague, but it's alright.",3
47952,"Only few starting videos give new information and techniques, the rest 80% is quite useless. Course would be much better if it gives real tips and techniques rather than constant repetitions of the same information in different forms. If you read the course contents - you already get 75% of what is presented in the videos.",3
47975,looks good ...lets see how much of help it can be to me Thanks coursera,3
48021,"I really like it. The course was a bit to short, but still I managed to learn few new things. It was definitely interesting plus interviews with well know people is a huge plus. Keep up a good work!!!",3
48028,"Nice tips, long for what you get out of it though",3
48084,"The tone of the course wasn't always to my liking (with the cartoons, animations, etc.) but there is some great advice in here, and I would encourage everyone to take the course. Barb's (the instructor's) personal background particularly resonated with me: she is someone who entered Engineering, a very demanding field, without much science background, and had to adapt to many new and challenging ideas. I am contemplating a similar change, and it's comforting to know that it can be done.",3
48088,The contents were interesting. Presentation rather poor. The speeches seemd disorganized. I had to rely on transcrips: downloaded and edited. The comments are at times too casual. And other times too much special terminology. Most of times I understand what she was trying to say. But listening attentively was very difficult.Heavy americanism impedes understanding; especially when the student does not have familiarity with US pop culture. I had to check how a pinball machine works. Zombis and four-armed (impossible) octpus were obstacles.,3
48162,"Meh.I appreciated the new perspectives on learning, and the smaller chunks of video and assignments (which allowed me to spread the work out over the week).The ""Thanks for Learning about Learning"" phrase was fine for the course introduction and the final module, but became annoying as the closing phrase. of. every. video.Dr Sejnowski's skills are reading a teleprompter distracted me - I suggest doing some practice and redoing the videos when the TP won't be such a distraction (watching his eyes track back and forth didn't do it for me).",3
48165,"Well presented, great communication and relevant content. The course was well designed and coordinated.",3
48176,"The teacher is not very enjoyable to listen to, however the content is very interesting.",3
48359,an online editor is not good,3
48393,"You cannot submit your quizzes nor your program assignment unless you're a paying member.This is the first time I ran into such a class in Coursera.Sad.Please allow non-paying people who want to learn, to participate in quizzes and peer graded assignments, like other institutions are doing.",3
48442,"It's not bad, but not amazing. I would recommend University of Michigan's Programming for Everybody (Python) over this course. While the game-oriented approach is fun, I don't like the excessive focus upon the simplegui module which was created by the instructors specifically for this course. You will learn some basic python concepts, but you'll spend way too much time learning how to use this module which you will likely never use again, and this is at the expense of learning how to use some of the more commonly used standard modules (eg datetime, sys, etc). I also found glitches in the materials, and many of the questions and grading rubrics are unclear or ambiguous. Very frustrating.",3
48444,"The course was interesting but I think Coursera is not quite what it used to be. The courses are more expensive (This one was $100). You can't do it free in a practical way, which on principle excludes people. They are simply replays of old videos and people are not inspired to participate in the forums.",3
48467,This course needs you to PAY!!!!,3
48472,Too easy.,3
48530,Excellent Courst but you have to pay in order to access the quizes and assignments... very dissapointing.,3
48545,"Easy to understand, but I just cannot recall too much half a year after finished it!Maybe it is a little bit superficial.",3
48546,Just a basic introduction to computer science.,3
48609,"The professor, Michael Scharf, seems to have a heavy bias to ""justice"" (as in punishment) and that leaves me with a poor taste as I listen to his content. I found an error in content that bothered me but did not interfere with the main points of the course. Overall I'm happy with the understanding of International Criminal Law that I have gained, though I am displeased with the biases I found in the professor.",3
48646,"I really like to the content of the course, but the problem of it is that it does not really incorporate the legal skills one acquires from Law School and is thus somewhat of a false representation of the case law that is offered.",3
48665,"This course gives a good introduction to international criminal law, showing in details the evolution of key principles and institutions. The readings , though details are a great resource for they keen to take deeper dives. The main concern , however is the sudden death approach that is used to evaluate the performance on the final examination. Preferably answers should not be binary, but provide the student with wide choice to gauge the degree to which performance on the exam truly measures knowledge acquired during the course (leaving little room for guess work, as it were).",3
48678,it was a interesting course,3
48690,Very basic,3
48704,"The content of the course is extremely useful for young emerging scientists like myself; however, the videos were very hard to follow because the team speaks fast and with a very strong French accent. The materials are well-prepared, but my attention kept drifting away from the content due to language impairment. Also, some of the introductory notes were lacking proper grammar and I believe that, in a course with such a theme, this is simply unacceptable. With a bit of work, I think this can be a very useful tool in writing scientific papers!",3
48711,"The course contains some interesting insights on writing a scientific paper. What I like about the course is that it is given by graduate students. But this is also a drawback. Sometimes, the material seems too simplistic.",3
48714,"It might have been a better option to conduct the class in the instructors' mother tongue with English subtitles, though concepts are well enough communicated. I am a Francophone and I still find it not easy to understand the English (having French translation in my mind.)A good introductory class to have a first glimpse at the general context of academic publishing. Good general overview to rethink the steps of publishing plans for early stage researchers.",3
48723,"A good course who teaches the way you have to do to write correctly a scientific paper, and gives an idea about the process of publish, it is useful and necessary for those who wants to continuous study and have their own work knows on the fields who works and research.",3
48725,"It is good, but there is a student speaking that is really difficult to understand.",3
48736,"Thanks to the course, learned a few tips on online searching. Some contents could be consolidated to shorten session times. Overall, appreciated Coursera's knowledge sharing.",3
48807,"Useful tips, but for the little amount of material, it's not worth $70.",3
48822,the peer graded assignment is too difficult for non-native speakers of English,3
48865,Completed it in a day but haven't read the recommended texts yet - which I will do. Some extremely interesting and thought-provoking material. Would have liked more than 3 weeks,3
48908,too repetitive and too much dialogue bullshit,3
48941,"A bit too commercial. Promise the cure for finding a job , but what did you learn ? This course might help you on awareness on your own abilities.",3
48952,I could not understand because i speak english...,3
48966,It's good but depend only save informations than understand it,3
48976,"Good use of figures and graphs. I like the input of historical references to help understand the material. Lectures can be disengaging at times, the professor uses a lot of pauses which makes it hard to follow. Overall, it's a good introduction and overview to material science.",3
49038,Instructor has lack of knowledge. They are not subject matter expert and they tried to deliver their best.,3
49040,Not really clear step up from the scratch to android/java programming,3
49042,"Switching back and forth between Linux and Android is going to be problematic. It adds an unnecessary complexity to the course and adds extra skill set requirements which were not mentioned as needed ahead of time. While they say you can choose one or the other, later lessons will only use one or the other (it switches) and this causes issues if you actually intend to follow along and learn something.",3
49078,I wasn't able to finish the course,3
49108,"I passed every quiz doing the course across 3 sessions, yet I cannot speak a sentence in Korean apart from 'hello' and 'thank you'. Something must be wrong with my brain or how the course is designed.",3
49139,"This was a good course, but much more ambitious than the description or name suggests. I had to watch the videos at 75% speed in order to figure out what was actually said, as I have never heard any Korean before. I used the quizlet flashcards and some youtube videos in order to learn the material, as the ""lecture notes"" were not always very helpful. So in all, a good course if you can access some supplementary activities. In fact, adding the quizlet flashcards to the lesson either before the lecture or before the quiz would be helpful for future students. I plan to take the class again in order to master the material.",3
49217,"Although the instructor was good at presenting the information, I felt that the reference sheets should of had the phonetic pronunciations next to the Korean writing. This would of helped learn the symbols better. After the second week, we were expected to know what they represented. I felt it needed a video on just learning the alphabet. I did still learn a great deal of vocabulary.",3
49265,"An alright starting course, but the exercises could be a little more in depth",3
49281,"It's awesome ,",3
49339,"Easy course. I would have preferred more English phonetic pronunciations, though. Everything was in the Korean alphabet.",3
49342,It was great overall but my review reflects the sentiment that I felt like they could've added more topics.,3
49411,"Gread course, shows the basic of IOT.",3
49425,Not good as this topic was not taught in great depth. For beginners it is good.,3
49439,"Starts very simplistically. Since I was auditing the class, there was no feedback for quizes of exercises.",3
49450,The course was too easy.,3
49476,A very basic course. Could have more in-depth information.,3
49480,A good overview of the landscape of of IOT.,3
49485,"The professor lecturers were great! I enjoyed watching the his videos. However, theres's still room for some improvement. For example, I would add /more/ technical info at the video slides and also a /lot/ of literature related to IoT and embedded systems.",3
49494,Didn't learn very much.,3
49516,"I felt it was too basic. It took me about a week, but if I'd had the time I could have done it all in a day. Hope the rest of the specialization is more in-depth.. Also there are no forums.. makes it impossible to interact when you have questions.",3
49561,"The content of the course is reasonable and gives an introduction to the uninitiated. The peer review sysetm however relies on the experience and knowledge of others which is a flaw in how some of the coursera modules are evaluated.If you are looking to expand your technical knowledge, opt for a course the has an automated test system (such as the courses on Data Structures and Algorithms).If you are just considering studying engineering, this course and specialization will be a decent and simplistic introduction into the field.",3
49598,The Best Explanation so far :),3
49600,"Reviewing process is quite slow, thus you have to wait until someone review your assignment and grade it, even if you complete this course in just 1 week but you can't pursue certificate in just 1 week because review of assignment 3-4 days minimum for each one.Coursera should improve that problem, but overall teaching quality was great.",3
49621,"This course is OK for introduction if you're not already familiar with the IoT devices and embedded systems. But if you already have done some projects in IoT and Embedded systems and are familiar with what they are then you don't need this course. This course is designed for a complete beginner who doesn't have any idea what IoT and embedded systems are (and now that you're researching about a course on IoT you probably have an idea what they are) and as a guy who had already done some projects in this area in undergrad, I found the content to be very simple and lacking any new things to add to my knowledge. But if you are a complete beginner then go for it.",3
49645,I like this lesson.,3
49673,"Don't get me wrong, this is a good course, the teacher obviously knows his stuff and delivers the information in a good way. It gives you what you need to know. But I expected more. A wider grasp on things, additional readings, quiz’s, related articles, links and so on. Maybe not mandatory but in addition to what already is there.",3
49681,Very basic course.,3
49684,Very high level.,3
49697,Pros:-Gives a brief overview of IoT ecosystem. Dr. Harris teaches complex things in an easy manner.Cons:-Assignments are not available for audit students. Request coursera to open assignments for audit students as well.,3
49703,"A good course for somebody who knows absolutely nothing about the presented subjects ( like networking, what is embedded software etc. ). Everything is explained in a way your grandmother could understand it.If you are somewhat familiar with them and are looking on information on what IoT exactly is, this course isn't really for you.",3
49770,Theorical Course. Nice for those that want to understand some concepts of IoT,3
49772,"Sometimes too easy, but may be good as a start point. Video lessons are long for the amount of the shared information.",3
49776,"I thought the content was great, but I thought the assignments were too onerous. I did the first one, but I didn't feel like I learned from it and peer feedback was very slow. I looked at the other assignments, but I thought they only asked me to put to paper things I was already thinking about anyway. Given the untimely and low quality of peer feedback on the first assignment, I didn't feel like I'd learn anything from completing and submitting any assignments. I refuse to buy a webcam for Coursera (I have a phone with that capability but the Coursera app doesn't support it for identity verification), so I can't get a certification anyway. I thought the content was interesting, but too basic to pay for. The major value I see in the certification path is extensive feedback on the capstone project, as I thought peer feedback came too late and wasn't extensive enough to be valuable. I do think the instructor does a good job of presenting the content",3
49792,The course is far too much introductory and the practical assignments are not challenging enough. Yet it is only an introductory course for the IoT specialization.,3
49826,Videos took to long. and uh fnck y=u,3
49848,This Course is very Good For Children.,3
49943,Intresting sinds my volunteering job with Coderdojo Belgium and my teaching job in 8th grade. I only expected more excercices.,3
49972,"The course itself is easy to follow and informative. However, the programming relates primarily to animations so is most appropriate for those interested in design, game design, etc. The course description should better specify this.",3
49994,This course is very basic,3
50002,Very few programming assignments..,3
50016,Should provide more examples and exercises for every topic. Research the web for additional exercises if you want to learn something here.,3
50035,"This course is not for absolute beginners. Even though I passed every exam and assignment, I found this course extremely difficult. I found myself having to rely on other lectures on python and book and internet blogs. This course is not a stand alone course as it if stated.I wish that there were more exercises where you could practice the lesson that was learned. I think each lesson should be accompanied by an optional exercise.",3
50040,Assignments and assessments took at least 2 to 3 times as long as described.,3
50136,"content is great and direct to the point. But 2 disappointing factors could have been avoided to make this course perfect1- sound is almost in one ear which can make you feel dizzy if you are using headset.2- instructor is reading everything like a robot. Very fast , no passion or whatsoever.I guess 3 stars is fair enough.",3
50149,"The content is interesting but the videos are quite long. Also, in the audit version all quizzes are blocked.",3
50290,He is awesome in reaching every aspect of Classical music.,3
50313,"The course itself is good, however the assessments need to be worked on",3
50455,I learned a lot of things related to journalism from such valuable course.,3
50518,"sir, could you pl. include some real time problems or natural phenomena while explaining a concept",3
50547,"Good course, and the topics covered during the course sessions were very much enlightening.",3
50714,This course is intended to tell about other courses but contains not so much useful information by itself.,3
50725,A decent introduction to the topic.,3
50746,Could be more in depth,3
50750,"Good intro course on software product management. The interviews with software product managers were interesting, as well as the supplemental materials (TEDtalks, reads).",3
50754,Not so inpiring,3
50758,Too basic. Interested to see if the next course will be more challenging.,3
50762,Course was helpful but final test was poorly worded and very confusing.,3
50764,Not much information for people who already work in related projects.,3
50765,"Good information, but the material is a little dry (the subsequent courses in the specialization are much more fun) - it's hard to make the introduction exciting, but adding some interactivity would be helpful.",3
50779,"It is a super-short course and is helpful mainly to give one an idea of what software product management means. I found the lectures on Agile principles, etc., very theoretical and textbook-style -- not too interesting.",3
50787,This course is very theory heavy. Not sure how memorizing concepts from the Agile manifesto will help in becoming a better product manager. I hope further courses are more application oriented.,3
50807,Decent introduction course.Without the rest it is useless in my opinion.So only take in case you want to follow the entire learning path.,3
50815,I believe this introductory course would be better if it stresses more on the Agile Manifesto Part,3
50816,Useful overview for the specialization....not sure it's the best overview of software product management outside of that context.,3
50833,"Nice introduction, although I don't see any reason to call this ""a course"", if it's less than 2 hours total (at least it felt that way) while we have to listen to an intro every 5 minutes of it.Would've rated it 2 stars based on the content, but the level of presentation was really good and I appreciate the effort.",3
50840,"This course provides general introduction to software product management which can help students to pick up founding concepts of a number of how a product management cycle looks like as well as the spirit of agile practices.As an introductory course, the material do not cover practical tools or details on how the actual product management should carry on. Expect the students should take the full specialization to advance the skills and knowledge to take the knowledge into a practical level.",3
50851,Very basic,3
50854,Very simple course introduction.,3
50884,Maybe not enough content to be a course.,3
50896,"Very weak on modern-day best development practices, and many of the ""phases"" discussed are closer to the anti-pattern of Waterfall, not Agile. I'm surprised to see an entire course on Software Product Management without a single mention of Lean principles.",3
50903,"This is good content, but way too broad and general to be considered a proper introduction. The course was too easy for my taste to be considered worthy of a certification.",3
50914,"The course was ok, just an introduction for the specialization. I'm looking forward to learn more in next courses in this specialization.",3
50929,"The information is good, but basic. Even at the reduced price, it seems pricey and this information could be rolled into another course.",3
50932,very basic,3
50950,It is ok.,3
50961,"Very theoretical course. If you don't know much about software management, this course might have some good info, but covers things you probably know if you have been involved in any software management.",3
50965,"Seemed like more of two week advertisement of the specialization and Agile, rather than a course. Some good information in the video lectures, but very heavy handed on the delivery.",3
50966,A bit 'light' on content but ok for an introduction.,3
50982,"The course is helpful for covering many aspects of project and product management, still it seems to be to basic which put in question whole specialization.",3
50994,The course is different from expected. It is more Software Project Management than Software Product Management.,3
51019,Easy to understand and follow. Good pace of lectures.,3
51089,Great subject and some very well presented videos. However there were several which were incomprehensible. Either because of the quality of the video or the very heavy accent of the speaker especially to a non-American viewer. One doesn't always want to read a transcript but to listen and concentrate. If all the videos had been of good listenable quality I would have given the course 5 stars,3
51098,"Overall this course has covered a lot of good and interesting information! I found the presentation to be lacking somewhat as the course-leaders were reading off the info in front of the camera, which gave the lectures an artificial sort of feel. I did enjoy the different interviews along the way, which spiced things up a bit. The grading of this course needs to be revised, in my view, as some things will go amiss when students grade each other. All in all it's clear that a lot of work has gone into this course, and that is definitely to be commended by all involved.",3
51132,"In general this was an easy, interesting and enjoyable course, Video interviews and lectures by key researchers in this exciting field were a highlight. It's an introductory course so not deep, but fun.A couple of things significantly detracted from the course for me.One was a feeling of unqualified evangelism. I think the microbiome is indeed a hugely important field, but the level of hype here, and lack of any critical perspective, was off-putting. This is particularly disturbing for products like probiotics, which have become a huge industry with little solid evidence to support them, or to choose between them. Also, they devote a lot of time to selling the American Gut Project. Which is a good cause, but I would rather they had spent that time teaching me something useful. I resent being duped into watching ads when I've signed up to be educated.The other thing that bothered me was the course required us to divulge a lot of personal information to other students in pointless, time-consuming projects. I didn't learn anything from these projects and found them annoying.",3
51157,"inspiring, easy to absorb",3
51161,Repetitive and surprisingly dry course.,3
51182,Course can be more comprehensive.,3
51189,Good content..but should also have some graded excercises,3
51255,Contain could been more in depth.,3
51310,This is a very helpful course,3
51317,"Too long for learning so little. I have learned more while reading a book for 3 hours, than with this course for 4 weeks. But anyway, it was helpful, because the more tasks you complete, the better you get.",3
51322,Its a good course but I expect more..,3
51324,Too vague on topics,3
51355,"This course is a good start if you already have a little experience with CSS. As a neophyte, I found that there was too much material for the amount of presentation time. I needed many more examples and exercises. I felt dejected each time the instructor said not to worry about getting it right and just experiment -- that's easy to say if you aren't being graded. The fact is that the material is extensive and often complicated, and it's imperative for me, as a student, to be correct as fast as possible. The result is that my grade (A) does not reflect my comprehension of the material. I managed to commit the material presented to short term memory so that I could pass the course, but as always happens when someone crams, the information is gone from my head.",3
51474,Missing key examples and explanation of so many terms a good try though I appreciate their effort to provide free knowledge.,3
51520,Course was great. I wish there was more coding and more examples as well as the videos showing more examples rather then slides with text of the properties.,3
51526,Very well explained. I think the professor is very good. But I expected to dive a little more in some details.,3
51537,"Good overview, but very detailed and definitely not for beginners - especially due to a lack of personal attention. I have had to supplement a lot of the material I missed through other resources. Still, a fairly good overview of CSS3 for those who already have a little understanding.",3
51594,I liked the emphasis on the spoken language and the bullets on China and its culture. I wish we had also the Chinese characters as in the first course; there were problems with the computer assessment of some of the quizzes.,3
51617,"The teacher is very nice.I rated it with 3 stars only because this course does not contain any information about chinese hieroglyphs. In my opinion it is the main part of the language, and should be included.",3
51625,"It's ok, good for remeber concepts",3
51629,"I'm torn about this course. The instructor's approach and enthusiasm are great, and the content seems fine. But with no direct access to the instructor, interactions come from discussion forums and peer reviewed assignments. The discussion forums were lifeless with virtually no staff participation. Throughout the 4-week course, there was one discussion thread with staff participation. Legitimate questions from students about content errors or technical problems went unacknowledged. Peer review is an understandable part of this course, but it has limited utility as the only feedback mechanism in a course populated by beginners.This course is still quite new. I believe it can and will be much better if the pool of students grows and there is more staff participation. It's still a worthwhile course as is, but a tougher sell than earlier courses in this sequence.",3
51631,"Great teacher, but i was expecting more advanced content. The assignments were very basic.I loved the ear training videos.The fact that you cannot submit the quizzes and the final assignment unless you pay for it is awful.",3
51642,I wish there was something more interactive than videos and multiple choice questions.Maybe a simulation software or something fun like that.,3
51645,"Interesting concept and great insight into the workings of a research project, yet limited in scope, effectively the long term effects cannot be proven on evidence and the practical feasability of the ideal seems to be rather limited. I would love to eat more deer, though.",3
51665,"I enjoyed the course but I think that it could have been more informative and a bit less repetitive. It would have been nice to have had some concrete examples of balanced Nordic meals. The course failed to mention dairy products. This said, I really think that the concept of the New Nordic Diet is great and should be adapted and adopted in other parts of the world!",3
51671,Its a Difficult one. I think less of reading work and more video lectures should be included.,3
51674,"The course is thorough and well-explained, but the tests' questions and answers are absurdly badly-designed so they become very difficult.",3
51675,"May be my english is too bad, but i found this course too difficult to understand, especially pick all the right answers in a list.",3
51676,its all reading no lectures..was boring,3
51691,"The class was informative, but the delivery of the material was less appealing. Much of the material could have been presented without so much of Melissa's presence and waving hands. It was very distracting. More visuals of the sites, tools, and ideas would have been better.",3
51698,"Better than the first, but it looks like each element was created in a single day. Some segments were repetitive and dragged on, though the instructor seemed both personable and knowledgeable. When the ONLY visual is the instructor, it gets hard to watch. An interesting model of both what to do and what not to do in creating your own online course.",3
51761,"Less is more. Not always, but it would be in this case. A lot of the lectures are unwatchable for me.",3
51772,Some of the videos weren't as clear as the previous course's videos. I suggest less gimmicks and more focus on learning the history. I will admit there were times I was lost on the quizzes because the videos weren't clear enough.,3
51890,the content should be presented more interesting.,3
51951,i dont want to know the history of language and the pendulum swing i just want a list short and simple in a single 20 min video and move one. this was so boring,3
51963,Really good organized,3
51972,"A great course and fully packed with interesting information about different methodologies thought time. Wouldn't give it 5 stars because most part during the video lectures are just silly and although I know the professor is trying his best to convey an idea, it seems like there are moments it just drifts away from the point. Also, the ""angel x devil"" debates are equally silly, opposite to the following overview video which is excellent. I'd recommend everybody to take this course but I certainly wouldn't do it again and neither dowload the videos for future reference.",3
52037,not so interesting and boring,3
52051,"Very nice course, active forum, no issues technical or otherwise -but- it is more about science than Philosophy.",3
52052,Excelent but haven´t this material in english,3
52082,"Seemed like a good course, however I could not stand this professor's voice so if that doesn't bother you I'm sure it is decent. (it might possibly be the poor audio that is off putting as well)",3
52098,OK but was expecting better. I was missing the structure a little bit.,3
52100,"Too much ideology, need more tools to use in daily work.",3
52110,Would be much better if it cited the studies that the professor refers to in the lectures.,3
52111,"While this course has great content, it lacks interactivity, exercises, peer learning opportunities and leaves desiring more real-life use cases and examples.",3
52124,"I'd encourage some refinement of the quizzes, for clarity purposes.",3
52132,"some quick and interesting input; kind of basic and superficial, though.",3
52252,"The course is perfect, however, since I am a person who prefers more concise information and pragmatic skills, the teaching examples with analyses might seem lengthy and not so efficient for me.",3
52337,"The instructor Jack looks very skilled in iOS, but is not very skilled in organizing his thoughts. Lot of sentences are changed halfway, making it frustrating and very hard to follow along.As in part one there is a steep chasm between the final peer assessment and the presented theory. Components required for the final assessment are introduced in part 3 of the specialization, which is to say a little late.",3
52346,"The lectures are much better than Module 1 BUT still too thin on information required to complete the final assignment. I probably spent 30 hours in all completing the assignment because I had to spend so much time looking up material that was not covered in the lectures. A lot of my time got wasted since it is very difficult to figure out the syntax/structure of the language from the very skimpy lectures &/or the very technical Apple documentation.Also, not ONCE did the instructors participate or respond to the forum discussion so it was not a surprise that the forum was barely used at all.I am stuck with soldiering on with the next 2 modules since I pre-paid for the specialisation but really I am very disappointed with what I am getting for a paid course.",3
52348,"It was good but I would really appreciate it if MVC was tackled in more detail. Also, I wish there was a video about UICollectionView. There were materials online about it but none of them was helpful for this this course's project.It was also a bit confusing to follow some sequence. Some codes were added then removed then added again. The explanation was sometimes confusing too.",3
52353,"There are no notes for the course and the structure is quite loose. There are no assignments besides a final app. The time frame is difficult to keep up with, if you're not a full-time student. You'll spend time looking stuff up and re-running videos. If you've never had a course using Xcode, this will be a steep-learning curve.",3
52355,Jack Yu is good person but don't why he does not his sentence and tells the less important thing first and the most important in last and because of this speaking style I am having difficulty in deep concepts,3
52357,Constraints were hard to understand even after re-watching the videos. I think more time could have been spent on the videos and more information could have been relayed to the students.,3
52361,"Relevant and well organized material when looking at it, but in total it is way too thin. More tips and tricks about Xcode as a tool would have been nice. Some of the videos are pretty unrehearsed. One of the lecturers hesitates and stutters a lot.As for the final assignment. Being reviewed by only three persons is too few. One of my reviewers had problems with his Xcode environment and couldn't run my submission. Guess how he graded me. The other reviewers had no problems, luckily.There is almost no help to be found in the discussion forums, which seems pretty buggy. There are no TAs and the staff doesn't seem to be very active either.I'm sure the course will improve in the future. It's at the time of writing the only Swift/Xcode/iOS MOOC on Coursera.",3
52363,needs weekly code testsneeds more quiz questionsneeds more usage samples - e.g. autolayout/specific UI components gotchas,3
52366,"Thank you.With all my respect to authors, I skipped Parham again and found a few errors, for example statements like ""if bool == true"" and layout related errors in the ""starter"" app at the end of the course.",3
52367,"A big improvement on the first course. Still, the material is not enough or you should have to do small exercises to prove that you understand the material. But progress is there.",3
52372,I was expecting something more in depth for methods and functions on swift,3
52376,"Course is really helpful, but definitely need an improvement.-Lot of information is Missing.-Need to be more clear in the lectures.-Similar course named iOS App Development for Entrepreneurs by UCI is constructed in much better way than this. Please take a look at it and try to make changes.-Udemy courses are more helpful, however i always prefer to learn with Coursera because of its reputation. So, please teach more stuff and help students to make most out of it.-The assignment was really challenging and interesting too. My humble request is to MAKE A VIDEO OF THE ASSIGNMENT WITH ALL BOUNS AND PUBLISH IT AFTER THE DEADLINE, that would be really helpful.",3
52389,"Much better than the first course on the specialization. More structured, easier to follow. The final assignment was challenging but not out of reach.",3
52390,"This could've been better, but i understand that you want to minimize time of videos, but at the end it lacks many information about delegates and protocols and so on",3
52394,Needs Improvement.Lecture and associated staff should participate more in the discussion forums.,3
52395,The quality of the course is not as I expected from a Coursera course.,3
52566,"In short, I am somewhat disappointed with the course overall. Of course both speakers have amazing experiences and that is valuable in itself but I do believe the structure of the lectures is not envolving as it should be. It seems that the basic rationale is being 'fired' in a not so much 'educative fashion'. Still there is much to learn from these contents.",3
52599,"Course and Assignments were good, but don't hope for an answer in the discussion forums.",3
52623,Discussion forums for this course was not quite helpful.,3
52635,"The concepts taught were very useful and interesting, but the only drawback I found with this course was the confusing nature of the Mini-Project.",3
52651,"OK, big improvement from first 2 in this series",3
52771,"Fascinating material; but accent of the lecturer was sometimes difficult to understand. The peer reviewed essays were good topics; but in one case definitely should have attached to the following week. The multiple choice tests, however, seemed to focus on trivia. Flawed; but still a really interesting course.",3
52784,A fascinating course but delivered in a rather wooden fashion by the lecturer. Good illustrations. I would have liked to have known more of the overall value (if any) of the Jewish contribution in the context of Chinese economic development i.e. was it of any overall importance- did it make any difference? Is it still relevant?,3
52791,Course content was nice. Delivery was good. Learn a lot that I have never been aware of.Course logistics was lacking. Hard to keep track where one was. Information about the course was sparse.,3
52797,"Most interesting topic, previously unknown. excellent illustrations, although flashed up too fast. Poor, sometimes erratic and tiring verbal presentation, which sapped energy for peer reviews.Can be greatly improved.",3
52828,"Bare bones. Pros: mostly clear, Cons: it may require outside supplements to fully understand and complete the assignments.",3
52843,"I love the content overall. However, I'm very disappointed that there are no video lectures at all. Ironically, I could find some old video lectures of this course on YouTube. The difficulty of this course warrants video lectures to convey many concepts and techniques, such as the Fitch system.Hopefully you can add video lectures back to this course.",3
52845,A little too slow for my liking,3
52848,"Reading and only reading! Could have at least a voice, some interaction!And is too expensive.",3
52861,"a little dry and boring,but it's very useful",3
52879,"Great experience and basic knowledge of PE & VC but too much theory, and no descriptions given about the assumptions made while valuation.",3
52894,I am almost done with the course. The course Is a great intro touches on some of the important subjects but it lacks the depth required to cover the topic appropriately. would love to see a specialization in this topic with more hours and content covered.,3
52901,There is not enough material. Course should be longer.,3
52914,"A good introductory course to the world of VC but fails to provide a deep enough dive into issues of internal VC/PE deal flow evaluation, processes. Not analytical enough.",3
52927,Great overall material.I think work needs to be done in order to improve the presentation of new concepts and vocabulary as well as the English of the speaker (and the corresponding caption).,3
53000,"Very nice introduction in the private equity world, I like that the differences are explained between the anglosaxon an european systems",3
53042,The course is really good and the professor well prepared. It should include more real life examples and it should analyze a real PE firm or fund. Most of the courses are abstract and they do not analyze a real life case.,3
53063,"Some few interesting insights on epistemology, but nothing more",3
53145,"The first few topics of the course were really insightful and valuable, but this trend didn't hold out for the whole course.",3
53295,Quite low level of detail - skips over lots of the underlying mathematics.,3
53321,Sad to know that I need to pay inorder to get a online certificate.,3
53390,"The lectures are great, but the assignments are way too easy. It gives little grasp of the difficulties involved in ML.",3
53693,A good introductory course. I recommend this course highly.,3
54217,it is a good beginner course with lots of detail.,3
54284,"Well constructed and easy to follow, but lacks mathematical derivation.",3
54548,"Good introductory course. It would have been nice to see some more deep mathematical demonstrations of the formulas, at least as optional videos.",3
54748,Matlab is very out of trends nowdays.,3
54805,"It was a great specialization - enough detail while still being high level and pretty clear and easy to follow. I was sad that they ditched the last two courses though - was really looking forward to them, and the specialization feels really incomplete without them.",3
55248,got better as I went along. The first few weeks were a little rough,3
55387,"The course provides a good description of the different types of Machine Learning algorithms. Yet, it doesn't include how to apply these in real assignments. And includes very little the combinations of different disciplines like Computer Vision, NLP and Data Science. This makes it very difficult to parse the content, and think about how to create applied applications.",3
55407,"Here I compare it with the data science course I took this semester (AC209a, Harvard University). This course is very introductory, with limited depth in the programming assignments. I recommend this course for those who have not take any data science / machine learning course yet.",3
55476,Simple and accessible introduction to Machine Learning for people without strong Maths and IT background. Can become quite slow and boring (almost irritating) if you come from an engineering or technical background (some videos could have been summarised in half of the time).,3
55479,It's so low that I can do nothing now after learning with every work in this course done.,3
55499,"I gained a solid conceptual understanding of Machine Learning, its terms, problems, and solutions. But I consistently felt unprepared for applying it in Octave.The audio is poor and frustrating, which the course addresses in the first week by essentially saying, ""deal with it"". Also, the instructor has no idea what ""intuition"" means, but uses it incessantly. It's a small nag, but it builds up over 11 weeks.",3
55528,Learnt the basics of machine learning. Looking forward to learn more.,3
56085,It's a good introduction to ML.,3
56415,"Nice course, but very practical at the expense of theory. A few mistakes in the lectures and some bugs in the scripts of the programing assignments that you need to manually correct, but not to bad. Very nice as a basic course if you have limited interest in math and just wanna start applying it. If you are interested in the math behind or mainly neural networks (which are only covered briefly), this is not the course for you.",3
56537,"Very useful course for newcomers to Machine Learning.The basic ideas are plain and clear and its cover major aspects.However, the value of the course would be much higher if the real practical examples are used in roll forward manner. For instance, throughout the course we are considering housing pricing from the plain gradient descent algorithm to much more complicated issues.So far, topics are too theoretical. An sometimes it is hard to apply to the practice.Moreover, it is nice to add the course with notes in pdf format because to listen or watch video lectures is not convenient. At least, it would be nice to have the set of outer links to read each topic in details.",3
56538,A nice introduction. Not formal enough.,3
56611,"Despite I guess the course has a pretty good coverage of the ML basics, it is definitely just an introductive class. In particular I was surprised by the low quality of the material.The following are my notes and suggestions:-- I found the lectures highly redundant, with many unnecessary repetitions-- using a vector notation (like an arrow or a simple line on top of the letters) throughout the course would have make formulas much more readable-- too much hand writing on the slides while talking: a better set of slides with blocks of text shown at the right moment would be much smoother and readable-- very, very poor video editing (many times it's clear some parts of the videos were meant to be cut!!)-- the desire to create a format suitable for people with a scarce algebra preparation lead to use not the appropriate terminology, which would be more correct and easier to understand. Just realize that ML is basically applied math, and without a good math knowledge it is almost pointless to approach the subject",3
56631,"homework assigments in matlab are way too painfulthinking about if i should add x0 = 1 or not, X or X', how to sum over i,j,k, that was ok in 2010 but in 2016 there are tools that will spare us such details",3
56711,The initial course is too heavy in theory without enough examples or exercises to follow up upon.,3
57069,Too simple course. It may be nice for juniors.,3
57204,The course gave a good introduction but with little proofs or derivation.,3
57249,Very educational. Maybe a short course in Liner Algebra could be included on Coursera also I have noted some of the assignments are a few years old as I have seen a few attempts to solve these on the web dating back to 2011. Maybe these should be changed to keep the ideas fresh.,3
57331,Maths covered is very preliminary. But the coverage of course is great.,3
57376,"Good overview of machine learning. In general focuses more on how to do, but due to course length skipped on some of the how or why in certain topics. Good mentor responses. Lecture video pause points are bugged. Lecture and assignments are quite detailed to walk you through it. Course content not designed to be difficult. Weeks are not very balanced. Some weeks take longer than other weeks, and you don't really know until the week starts. One thing I really dislike is you can't take notes online while watching the video. You'll have to do it elsewhere (on paper, on notepad). There isn't a quick summary of topics covered in the video you can go to. This would help if you wanted to rewatch a certain part but couldn't recall which video it was in.",3
57392,"The content is useful, but too verbose.",3
57406,"I am halfway through the course and while the course is able to give good intuitions of what's going on at any one point in time it often lacks dept.The real reason I'm rating it 3/5, though, is that the mathematical notation is all over the place. You will find a matrix product such as A*B' only to go on and implement A'*B. This is SO confusing.I would still recommend this course, but you should definitely record every single lesson again without mistakes and fix those errors.",3
57465,It was quiet mathematical for a beginner like me.,3
57609,"After years ,the math part of the course was difficult. Anyway, good course!",3
57780,"This is a great intro to machine learning, but it needs to be polished and updated. There's too much discrepancy over the assignment descriptions and the tutorial discussions. Tom Mosher is fantastic in the tutorial forums - would have spent many hours wandering aimlessly if it wasn't for his guidance. However, he does point out many holes in the course as it currently is, and I'd have to agree with him. Linear algebra review should absolutely be a requirement prior to the beginning of this course.",3
57800,"At later stages also , examples should be used for explanation !",3
57892,"Thanks Andrew Ng,",3
57929,Would have loved a little more theory.,3
57993,"I believe this course is great at all, but I also have to say there are a lot of machine learning algorithm should be taught in this course, such as Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, etc.",3
58059,"There are a number of issues with this course, and more generally Coursera. While the course does cover the material, it uses non-standard mathematical notation. This can be very confusing and seems as if it is purposefully so. There are several mathematical abstractions used that perhaps have a purpose in later machine learning applications but seem unnecessary here.Another issue is that the course assumes the use of Octave which is not available for Windows users apparently. It also allows the use of MatLab but the quiz questions are in Octave which means the quiz is not necessarily testing understanding of the course material as it is Octave.Generally, the opportunities for feedback to Coursera are highly limited. A colleague once took a course online (through another platform). Some of the course material was objectively wrong. However, there was no ability to submit feedback. I have the sense that this could easily happen with the Coursera material. It totally undercuts the apparent validity of the platform.",3
58115,"good , but elementary ( undergrad level)",3
58439,"Very good course especially for math/cs students - a lot of focus is put on explaining the math behind algorithms and equations, so if you search for practical examples and use cases, maybe try to look for another course",3
58446,"I am mixed on this class. I like it Ok because it gives you a deep level of understanding behind the numerical underpinnings of basic machine learning algorithms. But I don't feel like it's helping me become effective at using them. The course would get a higher rating if it focused more on practical applications, and not so heavy on the algebra. Also, it would get a higher rating if it used Python, rather than Octave for the programming platform.",3
58547,"fairly easy, good for start",3
59001,"I understand that many people want to quickly jumping on the topic, but there should be a minimum set of prerequisites before starting this class. This would avoid digressions such as explaining basic vector/matrix operations or unnecessary calculus reviews.",3
59036,If only the audio was clearer. Subtitles are also out of sync.,3
59114,"Audio quality is not great. Also, all concepts could be easily taught in Python rather than Matlab.Great material never the less.",3
59527,Good.. But not latest.,3
59664,"Poorly described, but versatile in coverage. Could do with accessing Lecture Notes.",3
59694,Assignments are too easy. I am not able to practice optimization methods implementation (Like - fmincg etc).Video lectures are good but at some places lack the explanation (Like how do we get the cost function of neuralnets). Still very helpful.,3
59851,The course has provided the insights into what is machine learning and how machine learning algorithms works. It would be good if it can provide real world problems and how to approach to solve them.,3
59883,"Good course. Introduces the basics well with a good emphasis on the underlying math. Bayesian techniques are missing. Also another suggestion : assignment submission in other languages , especially R - the industry language for prototyping ML algorithms.",3
60375,"A much awaited end for a very compelling specialization! Nevertheless, the work felt a little bit lonely since there was not any input from faculty staff, which led to some unsatisfactory feeling after some peer reviews.Other than that, it was a great opportunity to make a very interesting research and analysis in the framework of what we have learn in the topics of microeconomics, macroeconomics and data presentation.",3
60377,Instructor is very dry. Needs better on camera presence and ability to communicate the ideas. There should be more homework for practicing the material covered.,3
60391,"The course was very informative in the areas it covered, Unfortunately it almost totally ignored the Israeli Arabs who make up about 20% of the population; perhaps it is normal to exclude them in Israel, but this is supposed to be an international course. With regard to the 'peace process', we were informed that one of the major problems with 'peace negotiations' between Israel and the Palestinians was the 1948 issue, yet Rabin was clearly murdered because it was thought he would return land occupied in 1967 - so your analysis doesn't quite add up. As right wing and religious extremism in Israel and amongst the settlers has clearly worsened since Rabin's death it would have been appropriate to explained how it is now possible with a two state solution, and how todays level of extremism is likely to affect Israel itself.",3
60403,The course was very informative but the slides were a little boring. The content could have been more engaging. Sometimes the supplementary reading contained examples that could have been better explained in a video. I would have appreciate a more comprehensive explanation of content on slides using markers or pointers. Sometimes I did not know where I needed to focus. I hope the instructors create more videos for the same content. This is may be because I am more of a visual or an engaged learner.,3
60427,Content could have been boiled down to about 3 lectures. Most of it was common sense. The high level over view of the life cycle of data analysis projects was interesting and overall this was a good introduction to the field.,3
60436,"It is quite general, I liked the examples, although there could be more varied examples from many other dissimilar disciplines.",3
60438,"Lots of talking head videos without enough visual aids to solidify the adult learning process. Not very ""Executive level"" as the course title and description imply. I would expect more ""TED Talk"" level lectures and materials, with plenty of real-world examples. Content in these courses seem more ""new manager / new supervisor"" level, if not actually geared toward an undergrad audience.",3
60448,"Lot of talking, lack of visual, templates, etc.",3
60455,"Personally not a big fan of Roger Peng's approach while teaching. The lessons get a bit confusing, and so does the questions from the quiz.Jeff Leek's approach is more calm and simple.Nevertheless, the course in general is really good.",3
60456,I think these courses need to be condensed into a single one as the contents are rather limited individually.,3
60457,Concise overview. Worthwhile introduction.,3
60460,Very short. Quality of the course is OK.,3
60473,"Didn't get much into the managerial aspect of a data analysis. Instead, it covered best practices for conducting a data analysis. Not the same thing and a little disappointment.",3
60484,"Too abstract, too expensive.",3
60508,Too theoretical for my needs but gives a good background to how to approach analytics.,3
60509,Lecture component not as concise or well edited as expected.,3
60511,Not much substance to take from this.,3
60556,"long lectures, hard to understand material. Filmed in interesting locations relating to subjects. Not easy but worth the effort",3
60582,NO ESTOY DE ACUERDO CON QUE SEAN LOS ESTUDIANTES LOS QUE REVISEN EL TRABAJO FINAL DEL CURSO. DEBERÍA SER LA DOCENTE.,3
60610,informative but somewhat redundant. You can learn this stuff just fine at a stable. Tedious course.,3
60636,Good basic information overview. Helpful instructor.,3
60706,Good Course,3
60812,"Professional communication should be clear, correct, and effective. The course has helped me to improve these skills. Congratulations to everyone who took this challenge.",3
60820,"Great teacher, although I would rather need more examples of elaborate emails, that I could use at work.Thank you!",3
60822,Clear and essenzial focus on the main aspects,3
60836,Brief and accurate course. It provides useful information for writing professional emails. It´s a pity that the free version does not include assignments and peer´s review.,3
60848,Only brief course.,3
60873,Entry level for writing English emails.,3
60877,Unfortunately we can not submit our tasks with do Un upgrade in our account.,3
60899,"Good content, feels very automated",3
60933,A good course. Thank you.,3
60957,"It's a good course, with valuable information about Storytelling applied for Leadership in organizations. However, don't expect much depth in the classes.",3
60958,"Content is good, but exercises could be improved, should also add a few interactive quizzes (e.g. a quiz before the segment to ask what they think are the 3 - 4 factors of X,Y,Z; then a quiz at end to summarize). Also add sources.",3
60968,"This was a good course although the assignment at the end left a lot of room for improvement. Instructions were not clear and as a result, most of the assignments I graded didn't meet the scoring matrix...",3
60985,Needs to cover more material in a more engaging way. Felt too lecture-based and observational. Possibly story-telling itself needs to be anchored more to specific usage occasions.,3
60989,I think that this course could have more content.,3
60992,"Course is OK. Not too informative or too poor. However, it is in the same context with its specialization series.",3
60994,"The final assignment could use a little bit of work, from a clarity standpoint. I actually think that the exercise is quite rewarding, but the expectations of, and directions for participants aren't entirely clear (and that's coming from a native English speaker).",3
60999,"Very good, I missed a deepening of Storytelling elements",3
61002,"The first two weeks are focused on self growth, while the third is too focused on the company... I think it is a little bit incoherent. Anyway, it is a good course!",3
61003,"I like the course and the material; I would suggest to include quiz, to the end of each section.As well, it will be easier to write a story from final task after each section, not at the very end",3
61004,The topic was so intersting but the content was not enought practical!,3
61026,Good basic course for money management,3
61036,Basic course and good for high school to undergraduates as the title suggest. Good for overview of managing your finance. Budgeting which is the cornerstone of managing money is well talked about.Very limited coverage on the investing portion and I disagree that intelligent speculation in the stock market is the way to educate individuals starting out on investment. I would prefer Dr Navarro teaching this topic and hearing his perspective on stock market. Asking people to cash out when a stock lose 10% is equivalent to selling low and buying high. A better question is has the business change when the stock price drops. A better read would be The intelligent investor.,3
61041,"This is a good course. The only reason I am giving it 3 stars is because it was very general for me. But, for undergraduates and beginners, this is a good introduction and for them I would rate it 4 or higher. One suggestion, make this course a little harder by introducing some numerical problems or making the course with some more depth. I would reccomend these course to almost all freshmen and sophomores as essential to building good financial skills for their future.",3
61052,Good basics!,3
61080,I think this course is to basic. It's more for people who not has managment educational formation looks more like a personal financial course. its can get better but they need to add more advancing subjects.,3
61083,Good general information on basic financial literacy.,3
61085,"This course contained good information and it was discussed in a clear and easily understandable fashion. I was a bit disappointed though that the level was pitched quite low and so didn't answer a lot of the questions I have. If you have next to no financial literacy, however, this would be an invaluable course.",3
61125,"Nice course, though much of the content is relatively basic and only qualitative (for a professional, might be good for a new student). Wouldn't recommend following *all* the advice (e.g. on topics such as debt) but it's anyway interesting to have the perspective, and it definitely makes very interesting points.",3
61132,"I'm not going to recommend this course strongly. I learned from it, not denying that. The reading materials were great. There are critical organization issues to learn. But there are two things I don't like. First, the assignment is not well designed. Article reflection is a convenient way to give an assignment but sometimes off the topics in the course notes. Other courses have along assignments but they are much better designed. Second, the instructor threw a lot of terminologies with much explanations. I don't think people would ever remember or use them correctly. Why bother using them?",3
61134,The course lacks coherence which comes as a big disappointment as it follows two excellent modules by Greg Northcraft.,3
61138,"While I appreciate the logic behind this class, the content seemed very subjective and loose compared ot the class prior.",3
61176,"The vast majority of reviews for this course are glowing. Well done!Coming from a non medical background I found this course very challenging. I hardly used any of the suggested readings or references as I found them too technical. I had to start at a more basic (high school) level and work my way up. After many hours of work, many failed first attempts and countless hours of eating comfort food, I eventually reached week 13. Did I feel ready for the final exams? I suppose it doesn't matter because I did pass and received my certificate.",3
61225,it is a little hard to student who not major in medicine,3
61277,for me too much graded questions - but in generall the course is good,3
61306,"Hi team, I just had one feedback on the course content that there were some princip",3
61342,"a lot of reading existing content, less from the master himself :).. was hoping to get more business case examples. still, an amazing introductory course. thank you",3
61361,"I suggest including more practical examples in the videos in order to further understand the theory. Also, some concepts are mentioned but not explained.",3
61371,Was Super Boring Course Im sorry.,3
61392,The content could have digged deeper a bit more and the assignments could have been harder.,3
61401,"This is a very basic course. The contents do not cover a whole lot of ground. I personally did feel that there is a lot of repetition and this course did not help much . I somehow feel this course and the next ( the practical one ) could have been combined into one. Otherwise, not worth 2 courses of money.",3
61405,"I found that the five points to learn for each module become overly distracting. I hope the course doesn't face any constraint to get the five points. Otherwise, the course is fairly good.",3
61406,"This stage of the course i feel could be summed up to just one week worth of work. It mainly revolves around ZMOT and best marketing analytics and data collection techniques and rawly around 30 minutes of content, and the last week was more of a ""let's sum up"". Compared to the first stage where every single week had a new subject, with lots of content this one i feel, just didn't cut it. I do feel I learned a lot from it...and i plan to finish the specialization, but this one should be aided as part of another another module.",3
61429,Interesting course but would have liked some additional video discussions from practitioners in the field.,3
61431,"Informative, but needs more challenging assignments.",3
61435,"sometimes is dense, a little bit boring",3
61438,"For an introductory course it is ok, however can't help get the feeling that the material is just skimmed through. In an effort to structure each session in the same way, detail has been missed out. Practical examples and hands-on exercises are very inadequate. Not impressed.",3
61441,I don't like the peer review. I don't find it helpful at all.,3
61456,"This was a good course, but a bit elementary.",3
61465,The instructor is really makes the topic boring. I would also like to see more examples of real world application.,3
61472,Good class but very little case studies or real world example.,3
61483,well organized but need more assignments and practical assignments,3
61485,The content is very similar to the Marketing analytics in practice one,3
61491,"Compliments: The course introduced me to a number of reporting and research tools that I was not aware of. I have also become a great fan of Avinash Kaushik and his blog in the process.Criticism: The lecturer could have gone into more details in many areas of his course as opposed to just assuming that the prescribed reading material had been read. Many detailed points were glanced over and one prescribed reading material (Peterson, E. T. (2004). Web Analytics demystified) was written in 2004 and as a result much of the information presented in this text book is very outdated.",3
61494,"Short and sweet, easy and quick and gives a genX some insight into GenY (and now GenC",3
61495,Great informative course,3
61498,"The professor knows a lot, but it could be a more deep course rather than just a introduction.",3
61502,This course is good introduction in digital marketing.,3
61504,"The course is much too easy, to my mind. Some more practical exercises or more readings in fundamentals could be a nice addition.",3
61535,This Module was very interesting. It just have to be updated as things change so fast!,3
61543,The lecturer seems to be reading off the text - could be better.,3
61550,"The course is really worse than previous too. Information is to abstract, the teacher tells some obvious things. The one thing I liked are course materials - for this I give 3 stars, not 2.",3
61551,"The content is good but I see some space for improvements in the structure and delivery. I would like to just give positive feedback: 1) the videos and power point slides are broken in too small parts. Each movie/power point starts with the same advertisement and music and it is taking time and attention. Suggestion is to reduce the nr. of videos/presentation to just one or two. 2) for some reason the teacher is looking for my ""rigth side behind my shoulders"" and not ""to my eyes"". I guess there is a small mistake on the camera positioning. It results in loosing the eye contact. 3) There is no ""call to"" go to forum for open discussion. There are no suggestions to topics to be discussed as well. All the forum sessions are empty. The course shall ask comments on the forum like the other courses do. Apart of that small issues, overall the content is quite important and the instructor is good.",3
61554,"The Instructor is excellent and easy to follow. The readings were rich with information. The subject matter is very good, the quizzes reinforce the information instructed, and the testing is sufficient.I would rate the course a 4.5 with the exception of the Peer Review portion. The staff does not enforce the Rubric Instructions for the Peer Review(at least my experience).Most reviews do not critique, offer constructive criticism, and in some cases I am confident, the answers were not even read. I would like to know why a score was felt appropriate... if I received a 10, what worked so well? If the score was a 7, what can I do, in your opinion, to improve the answer? The overwhelming majority of reviews were simply ""very good"", ""excellent"", and ""nice job"". These answers do not fulfill the rules outlined at the start of each course and I believe students not completing the Review properly should have their grades reduced or listed as incomplete.",3
61559,"The content was good, however Prof Clifton is very difficult to listen to and watch on the videos. Mistakes in the PPT and her presentation skills do not meet the expected standard. She seemed as though she didn't know the material and is seemingly unaware of what is required for successful on-camera delivery of lectures.",3
61567,"The proposition of the course is very interesting. The content, especially from the required book is very good but I think the instructor could dive deeper in the content of her lectures and they could be a little bit more dynamics.",3
61573,The lesson is informative but the course professor does not share value on each slide. She's reading each point and does not provide additional insight.,3
61577,The video lectures are not engaging at all.,3
61578,not very creative in terms of approach,3
61579,"The books, readings, and additional resources for studying are really good and helpfull. The only thing is that the videos where they explain the courses could be more fluid, dynamic and with a better domain of the tool by the professor.",3
61582,This is basic content i wish it was a more outside just a lecture style where the lecturer just reads from the slides.,3
61584,"The content is good, but the way the lectures are given not so much.",3
61591,"The content of this course is very good. However I feel it is unfortunate that the lecturer did not make an effort in preparing the presentation of the material. This makes a huge difference. Especially when it is an online course, the lecturer needs to bring the story to life rather than simply reading with hesitation from the slides in most instances.",3
61608,Course was poorly put together with errors that are not fixed.,3
61610,"The course structure is okay and availability of course material e-book is big plus for the course.However there are negatives also.This is a course on ""Digital Marketing"" and it has to be taken to great heights in terms of content and delivery.Most critical issue is delivery. The most happening and lively subject like this needs a delivery in a exalted method. Though reference material is good collection but there is total disconnect between video lectures and those reference material at many instances.Revamp all video series. Add more case studies videos.",3
61612,Among my registered courses in the specialization this course is the one that should be invested with more effort from creators in order to give students more practical lessons. Regards.,3
61619,"Course was pretty boring, repetition of Digital Marketing previous modules, would appreciate it more if the professor did a better presentation!",3
61620,The landscape is quite basic and would require further development to be more relevant,3
61621,"Good course but it's too much academic, I can see that you were talking things you don't understand or read a script without put any of your efforts.",3
61624,"A little bit too basic, I expected more.",3
61641,very slow pacing but ok content,3
61643,Some times the questions in the test were in my opinion irrelevant to the material.,3
61652,It would be great to make a voice-over in English as well,3
61683,"Only average. Much is said, little information delivered.",3
61685,"This course is wonderful and I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it. BUT, it is not well monitored, the peer review process is broken and questions are not answered, making it frustrating. For example, I wrote an essay and received a non-passing grade. I re-wrote it and submitted it. The comments back were very good, but the grade remained a non-passing one. Very difficult to figure it out. I posted a request for clarification and received no response. So, course GREAT, administration of course, not so much.",3
61708,"On scientific and philosophical reflections there are unbalanced focusing and biased approach to Enlightenment tradition of thoughts and Utilitarions views in particular, on the very contrary to what Prof. Shapiro explains in his MOOC ""Moral Foundations of Politics"".",3
61723,"It's a little annoying, because the videos are the same all the time... but the professor is very good, he knows so much about filosofy!",3
61726,"though the flow of ideologies eventually became distinguishable, the comments on the several artists and philosophers noted were woefully uninformed and inadequate, even distorted, and the professor's eventual humming and hawing, irritating in the extreme, suggested that he was not at all prepared for his lectures - the final presentation of paintings without commentary at all was thus both a relief from his indecision and, at all of twenty minutes, an outrageous waste of time having left all of these however masterful works without any appreciable context",3
61785,"very compressive , not long enough and still there is many info i didn't get !! :(but thnx any way for ur effort :D",3
61811,"Did not like the peer-graded dynamic, and also the lectures were pretty basic, I felt that it lacked depths in some subjects.",3
61818,This course was disappointing compared to the first course in the series (Introduction to Data Science). If you enjoy reading academic papers and peer reviews then this course is for you. If you don't then just search the web for tutorials on Matplotlib and Seaborn.,3
61821,I gave the feedback to the detailed survey by the University of Michigan. I enjoyed the course but I would like some more guided work before facing the assignments. I think the professors can elaborate better the course,3
61823,The last week assignment is easier and no strict rules to achieve. The majority will do the minimum to finish the course.It would be more efficient to push all students to make hard plots in Matplotlib (interactive + animation) with strict rules.This is not a level of an intermediate course!,3
61827,The first week was interesting as it broke down the different layers that occur behind the scenes of matplotlib. The next couple of weeks felt a little shallow and rushed. Maybe we will explore more of the functionality in the later courses.,3
61837,"Pretty well structured class, but quite expensive considering very limited lectures and assignments that are mostly ""find your own challenge on the internet"".",3
61838,"A good course that could be better.I think that this course provided a reasonable introduction to Matplotlib, but the lectures need to go a bit deeper and provide more examples. The course left too much of the work to the student. [For your reference, I have a PhD in Mathematics, taught for several years at a highly selective undergraduate college, and have extensive experience in industry as a Matlab and SAS user.] The homework assignments were substantial, and I enjoyed doing the final assignment which required merging two or more datasets using Pandas and then Matplotlib to plot relationships. The course website provides estimates of the number of hours required to complete the assignments, but these were gross underestimates because so much about Matplotlib was left to the student. I would have preferred a bit more lecture time, more examples, and a few side tutorials on using Jupyter and notebooks (how to download and upload), especially since we were grading the code of our fellow students.",3
61839,"Seemed more introductory, here are the tools - go have fun rather than actually teaching teaching",3
61846,"The first course in this series was really good and this one was so-so at best. I got some skills out of it since I obsessively plotted everything and over did the assignments, but the peer grading rubrics are crap. It's all or nothing so if you submit *anything*, you get a grade (and it usually approaches 100%) but I didn't really get much helpful/thoughtful feedback on anything I did since you literally get ZERO feedback from the instructors (nothing!) nor did I get much in the way of helpful info from the people who peer reviewed my work. I find that pretty disappointing really.",3
61851,"First of all, the instructor is very responsible, keep updating information on the forum and course material. The course is a decent level of basic plotting technique review, should be in more detail. Compared with the first course of this specialization, this second course is much less challenging, require less effort to accomplish. The first course is the one attract me of this specialization, the second one, somehow, is a bit disappointing, especially compared with plotting skill of R in another data science specialization, which is even an elementary level course. This course cannot be labeled as intermediate level.Another problem with this course is the peer review, the grading policy should be changed to punish irresponsible reviewers, no useful feedback got. What kind of responsible one provide feedback in two words, where require to answer three questions (week 4 assignment) to review.",3
61857,Decent overview but could have spend more time showing plotting techniques in more detail than showing what makes an appealing plot. Also The section on the back-end of MatPlotLib was more detailed than it needed to be for quick overview but not detailed enough to be very useful.,3
61871,This subject could be more productive if they'd go a little bit more into details on how to start and apply all the strategies they have taught us.I do appreciate the hard work and knowledge sharing on this course.,3
61923,"This is not a bad quality-price course but after working Accounting and Finance IESE courses I have to say that this one does not have the same level. To improve specially content organization: firt week is very heavy comparing with the others. The first and the last videos of the course, in Starbucks, in a very windy day, they have a very bad audio. The fourth week exam doesn't offers the pdf of the results. In final exam results they say 3,8 is 45% of 15,3 ¿?... Anyway, I expect more quality in the next course of the program ""Managing people""...",3
61924,"The course content was mostly great and clear, but on occasion it lacked proper elaboration and definition of subjects discussed.",3
61932,"Although the idea of this course is excellent, the reason I gave this course 2 stars is because of the logistical issues with the peer review process. SInce the idea was for participants to develop a project with ongoing editing based on peer feedback, this process is key. There were issues with accessing comments from peer reviewers and not enough submissions for me to complete all the required peer reviews. In the end, coursera staff were able to override the last bit so I could complete the course, but the experience was quite frustrating and disappointing. The other learners who I did have a chance to share work with were wonderful and thoughtful and several also expressed similar frustrations. This capstone course could be improved with the addition of supervisory staff/project mentors. Overall, however, the 4 course series was excellent.",3
62025,Very few o no information about the Latin America,3
62044,We need less lectures and more application based courses.,3
62076,Too easy to learn,3
62121,"Given the great reviews I expected a lot more from this course. It does cover some new developments and provides good examples, but otherwise quite boring and standard fare.",3
62126,Interesting!,3
62139,"Course itself is interesting, but cases need to be updated. Digital world is changing very fast and articles from and examples from 2010 and even from 2012-2014 are not actual anymore.",3
62156,"In general I liked the course and content! However, some cases studies should be updated. The digital world changes dramatically fast and the course must follow it. We always expect to learn the latest trend and current examples.",3
62203,"The content is already old and needs to be updated. Of course it is still actual, but still - the newest text are from 2014, so newer examples would be great.",3
62219,"Too basic, lack of academic insights, too much simplification of the concepts.Suitable and for sure insightful for participants without any business background whatsoever, but not for others.",3
62226,The professor is excellent and presentation materials are very good. I gave only three stars because much of the course content is outdated by over 5 years and in some cases over 10 years!. This is unacceptable in a digital marketing college level course because the technology evolution cycle is getting shorter with each passing year and some of the case study examples are now obsolete.,3
62262,"Some of the examples used and the assignments given were quite old dated that no longer exist. Also, some of them were region specific tasks. This is a global course site and hence course structure should be such that every region could easily access the information and can contribute well in the assignments.",3
62273,"Very elementary introduction of key concepts. Some of the material is a bit dated too.Overall, it was structured nicely and not terrible.",3
62281,"The course was informative and engaging. However, the process of receiving peer reviews on exercises was extremely frustrating and detracted from my overall satisfaction with the course. Many people ignored the grading criteria and gave me a lower score than was warranted, despite having answered the question(s) fully, referencing lecture material and even including additional information sources (all of which was referenced with links). I know that I am not alone in this experience, as these types of comments come up frequently in the forum posts. Since there is no recourse for a poor grade other than to resubmit an exercise to a new cohort of peers and hope that they are more fairly critiqued, this grading process puts students at the mercy of peers who either do not understand or do not care about the instructions for grading each other's work.",3
62317,"Great learning overall. The down side I've found is that Peer review assignment, some of the peers don't review my assignments nicely, I tried to make interaction but seems not working.",3
62355,Good course for someone seeking to know fundamentals of Digital Marketing.,3
62361,"This Course needs a Update, im really disappointed of Week 4 and the Assignments are Outdated and nothing new",3
62379,Found it to be a bit outdated.,3
62400,Good start to the course. Though I feel more energy and enthusiasm by the instructors would uplift the course. Some content is not prevalent at present (outdated).,3
62403,Interesting concepts and introduction to the specialization but I wish the lectures were more natural and energetic.,3
62413,Very interesting to have a broad view of how marketing tools create value to consumer nowadays.,3
62417,The concepts and knowledge this course covers are useful and practical. The length of the videos is the only thing I dislike. Sometimes they are too long.,3
62430,"I found it to be a very basic course, instead of being offered as a separate course this could actually be covered in one module as part of the advanced level. Also, some of the case studies are outdated as i could see the course was developed in 2014. given that its a digital marketing related course, it becomes all the more important to have more recent and relevant case studies for this course.",3
62457,This course definitely enhanced my marketing knowledge but I recommend it be updated. Assignments such as Red Laser should be updated considering the app has been shut down.,3
62460,"I thought the course was illuminating and a great start to the specialization. I had me thinking and discussing what I learned. Professor Aric could use a little more energy as he had a very scripted feel to the lecture videos which almost felt like he was reading from the marketing dictionary. However, he was very thorough and informative.",3
62468,elementary .. good.,3
62490,"Overall okay, but feels quite outdated. As a marketing professional and child of the digital age I feel like the course didn't go deep enough.",3
62492,"Some good case studies and interesting content, but it's a 50,000 foot view of marketing. I was seeking a more technical and channel specific insights. This is much more conceptual and high level, so it was less useful for me.",3
62493,"I found the information dated and the exercises applied to digital marketing as a consumer first and foremeost secondarily as a B2C marketer. A B2B exercise would have been valuable as well because the markets act so different. Some of the exercises were not remotely useful. I did enjoy the Radiohead, Threadless, and Thingiverse exercises and learn from them.",3
62496,"Useful eye opener in different directions.Out-dated, could use an wisp of technology update with a few years since recording.",3
62539,"Videos rather slow and don't keep you focus. Voice of the professor is rather low key and slow. Hard to pay attention at times. Even though there are examples, it should be more interactive with other videos rather than links of text.",3
62569,"This course isn't what I anticipated. I see where many topics related to ""marketing in a digital world"", but most if any had a indirect relationship.",3
62579,"The course content was comprehensive, thorough and required note taking with preparation for quizzes. Solid academically.Some of the assignments required use of third party applications and websites that did function as anticipated or are no longer supported.Peer grading was very poor. It frequently seemed students did not read submissions, off handedly grading. At times comments did not match the scores, such as ""nice work,"" or ""good job,"" while giving only 3 stars.",3
62633,"The professor is a bit monotone, he needs to be more animated. There are too many assignments , not all can be done while living outside the United States.",3
62641,"Terribly boring. Valuable information, nonetheless.",3
62677,May be too wide in terms of issues,3
62689,"I liked that there were many practical exercises and it was talked about many crazy new technologies.Still, I feel that there was a lot of subtle publicity throughout the course and sometimes the focus was more on the promoting a brand than the lesson and knowledge itself (ex. 3dhubs, the professors lab, Daqri, ....).I understand that to understand better, we need examples, but I wonder if it could maybe be done in a different way.Nevertheless, I learned a lot.Thanks a lot for all the lessons!",3
62699,"This is a valuable course which tells you new innovative concepts about digital marketing, but I think many ideas introduced here are going to work for large businesses. so as a small business owner this course is not perfect for me.",3
62720,Nice course for practical knowledge of new marketing concepts / possibilities through the changing digital environment.,3
62760,you cant do the final thing unless you pay so That minuses 2 stars.,3
62822,"I would give it a 3.5, with the extra 0.5 because of the great interaction, ease of use, and clarity of progress. It was pretty hard for me and I barely made it in under the deadline (jumping session to session to complete). You definitely need some R background by the end for the project. I expected to get more in information in using R for inferential statistics too... though there was a presentation and each lesson had followup for use in R. Great use of examples for each section. That helped me a lot.",3
62928,Course could be better,3
62939,This level of detail was good for easier statistical concepts but there are much better courses on Coursera for Machine Learning,3
62940,It's not an intro class. But you can practice a lot if you know something.,3
62941,"Disadvantages : Lacks Rigour, Lacks Support from instructors , Expensive , Peer review ( this is somewhat bad as most barely give any comments, though towards the end, reviews tend to be pretty good). *** DISCLAIMER *** I am not statistically significant as i only receive 3 reviews per week.Advantages :Quick to earn cert, prewritten code available for easy use. Assignments on your own data. This is probably useful for people wanting to learn techniques for data analysis, who need not go too deep into the technique.I would recommend this to people learning techniques for data analysis in various non-mathematical and non-statistical fields, though the content lacks rigour, and you need outside sources to help understand techniques.This course IS NOT WORTH PAYING USD79, there are definitely other courses much more worth the money. You can audit it for free, if you do not want a cert.",3
62945,Not deep enough on diagnostic and interpretation,3
62946,"It was okay for an introduction to the methods, but I would have liked to learn about them in more details, i.e. the course was too short.",3
62953,"Good course, but could have explored the topic with more depth.",3
62998,the course stays a bit superficial,3
63031,This is an interesting course but I'm disappointed at the lack of female lecturers/interviews. I'm a female and would appreciate leadership/encouragement via role models from educators in this traditionally male-dominated field.,3
63060,"Very useful course with good information. Current iteration is a little rough as an online course, could use a little thought into the peer-review process works specifically around how to distribute the code.",3
63061,"The contents of the course are interesting, but it feels too short, and the assignments trend to let you down (the scoring system is sometimes a bit brainless)",3
63137,a good one for gaining more knowledge regarding managing people,3
63152,The module of legal was very focus on US which does no apply to international students.,3
63186,"The course was overwrought in general - seemed like it could have been accomplished in four weeks instead of five. The instructor was clear most of the time, but there were places were the concepts were unclear, probably 80 percent was on target. This might explain the inconsistent grading of written assignments. Needs some fine tuning, but worth the time.",3
63194,Very good but slightly basic. Great starting point.,3
63200,The concepts were interesting and helpful. It would be professional of the instructor to cite sources and employ classic principles of curriculum design. The construction of quiz items is a particular opportunity for improvement.,3
63205,"Very good for those who start, inspirational for whoever. Thanks. Blaho",3
63208,i supposed that may be i am not very clever so the content and the question after the class also make me confused. a little bit disapoint with this course. but i saw a lot people below think this a good course so may be i am wrong.,3
63243,basic knowledge about synthesis that you get anywhere on the net.,3
63264,"Course is good and very interesting, but extremely little interaction takes place in forums, especially not at all from the moderators.",3
63288,Sometimes I don't understand when the lecture gives some examples of an abstract concept,3
63299,Good Course. Taught well. Should be free certificate. Thank you.,3
63354,"Not really a fan of Mick's way of teaching, he seems to have spent most of his time playing with the music or drawing app rather than explaining the features. I also think it would have been helpful to explain more about the purpose of Session.get for retrieving the features and plotting them into data. I think one of the issues with this is there aren't really many active folks on the discussion, so it is difficult to try to find a solution to problems you are having.",3
63356,Just showing examples of some good projects and their code at most part of the course .Also comparing Meteor with Wordpress is wrong and I don't think Meteor will reach Wordpress.After all they are different tools for different jobs.,3
63377,"its not bad, but its not great either..the teacher's passion for music may overcloud his jugment..",3
63380,i thought the course is about showing us some examples of responsive web designs and how to make creative responsive websites as the title suggestbut the course is about 4 basic websites and how they are developed using meteorit goes on describing how to code this stuff and how the code logic is written and add a little to the meteor learning experiencei suggest you change the title of the course to be what the course is really about,3
63399,"I really liked the 2 first weeks, but when it came to the week 3 and 4 I started struguling more understanding the meaning of the multiple equation that where explained because of a lack of real life context use.",3
63401,"On a whole I am satisfied with he expanse of the course curriculum. However, I wished it covered certain in greater depth such as the Quantitative methods of Marketing Research. Also certain parts of the Consumer Behaviour section were quite repetitive.",3
63411,"Quite interesting course, I would prefer more practical examples. Week 4 could have been split in more sections. Was difficult to follow.",3
63412,Not up-to the expectation. Course content was not of that much strength. Other parameter were pretty well and test question of week 3 were good.,3
63419,"It was a very theoretic course.I would have enjoyed it more if more real life examples were compared with all the theory.At some points I found it too tedious, even though I found marketing an interesting subject, I have to say that the last 2 weeks I found it really hard to pay attention and follow the class.Ways to improve it: More real life examples and more visual explanations.",3
63479,"Long, especially the week on Iran. Really proud of myself for getting through it.",3
63544,"I once had a boyfriend who said my mind was like an encyclopedia that had come free from its binding. To some extent that's true, and it makes me, I think, fun to drink with. I think the Prof of this course would be super fun to drink with, too. I can only imagine the directions the conversation would careen, how many diversions and reversions and tangents we would go on. In terms of instruction, though, I find it rather exhausting. First we're talking about Ottoman reforms, then a diversion into Goethe (or some other dour Teutonic thinker) then a tangent into- but we'll cover that in another video so in 1924, but if you read L'etranger.... I've taken to listening to the lectures while doing something else, and then parsing the transcripts, trying to tease out some sort of linear narrative for my notes and it's just so effortful and time-consuming.",3
63597,I took this course before when everything was still free... too bad I can only audit the course now. still good course though! :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :),3
63614,The Good:Very palatable content and provides information at a very slow pace for ease of learning.More reasonable content and far more worthwhile than the first Arduino course of the series.The Bad:Not worth the money when looked at generally. The first and second course could easily have been merged. A lack of introduction to electronic circuits also hinders full use of what is being taught.,3
63637,I don't like to tie quiz to the paid course,3
63647,Not that detailed stuff.,3
63652,Very well Explained.Tried to cover basic in very systematic way.,3
63667,"Interesting course, however more examples could be included",3
63668,The course is good but I'd like a more complicated one. This is too easy.,3
63675,the pace was too fast. it would have been nice if there was any a complete but simple example after teaching each concept. specifically regarding I2C everything was in rush.,3
63690,Course contents are fine.Unfortunately the absence of a course board where students can discuss and eventually receive help from the teacher has an bad influence on the course overall rating,3
63697,Need to update assignments,3
63708,Not really in debt treatment of the subject. Lacks realistic applications.,3
63725,"I think this course is missing some key elements for a complete beginner. I would suggest to expand on Bootstrap and how to work with it. For example, what do I do with the bootstarp files I have downloaded, where do they go, how to find their classes etc.",3
63734,"We were introduced to Bootstrap, but not taught much about how to use it and how to structure our html for it.",3
63741,It focuses too much on bootstrap framework instead of in my view focusing on building responsive sites from scratch,3
63744,Not as good as the former three in the Specialization. The BootStrap part could be better in my opinion.,3
63790,"I understand peer review is a bit difficult, but being quiz only made this course a bit too easy. Colleen is a great teacher though and I like her unique teaching style and viewpoint.",3
63857,Very helpful but sometimes it is too slow,3
63886,Too many videos with repetitive content. Homework was much more complicated than the information given.,3
64111,Some quiz questions ask about material that is not discussed until later lectures. Some quiz questions are vaguely worded. Course seems under construction - many later lectures unquizzed?,3
64136,"Very nice, interesting but videos are too long comparing others courses.",3
64190,"The course material was very interesting! The videos were a bit too lengthy, however.",3
64212,Nice course but I would have expected more techniques (SVM for instance),3
64247,"Turi stopped working on SFrame (at least on Github), and SFrame does not supports Python 3. Expect some difficulty if you use other tools like pandas - the programming assignment completely assumes you use SFrame. Fortunately data of csv format is provided, so you can complete it anyway but again, don't expect a smooth ride.Also the lecture tends to cover general concepts than mathematical details. I don't like it, but that would be a good point to the starters.",3
64255,"The videos were pretty goods. But a bit too slow and easy. The assigments were ok, but too guiding. Also there were too much reimplementation of algorithm",3
64275,"Well, after the regression course, which I actually found interesting, the classification course doesn't look so good. The programming assignments are mostly pointless. The use of graphlab doesn't make it better. The info presented in this course is rather superficial. If you're entirely new to machine learning, you could find some value in this course. If not, go buy a good book.",3
64314,"Compared with the regression course, this course was a slight disappointment. 1. there is less material compared to the regression course. Maybe this is because classification concepts are more intuitive. 2. the slides are much less prepared. Some of the sides even re-use earlier lesson slides in the beginning as a ""review"", much like soap operas re-use scenes from earlier episodes as ""memory recall"" to fill air time. 3. the math is more handwavy compared to the regression course. Neither course are supposed to go in depth with proofs, but I felt the regression course was at the right level and this course degraded too far. Do note it's very possible that I'm biased because I have seen more of the material from this course than the regression course.",3
64330,"All of the courses lecture are great until it reaches week 5 where it's really hard to catch, the programming assignment doesn't give enough hints and lecture in this topic doesn't help much.",3
64339,Exercises for Scikit-learn users were not organised.Course took too long to start,3
64340,"First. I like these courses allot. They are pretty close to covering just what you need to actually do machine learning in the real world and not dive too deep into topics that have no practical value.However:This course was a bit too thin, the last 4 weeks of the course contained little in depth informations and seemed to brush over allot of different topics that could have contained more information. Although they where important topics the course could go more in depth on at least 3 or 4 of those topics. The last 3 weeks could have been a course on its own if properly explored. However the concepts are well enough covered to be usable in practice i belive.The programming exercises where ridiculously simple. Everything was reduced to filling in 1 or two lines in a bigger function. I understand that the point was to see how these functions are made and that it increases our understanding of the algorithms already existing in packages like schikit-learn and graphlab. Also the content became a bit too repetetive (actually started in the second course but continues in this course). The time used on variation over the same topic in different models made it challenging to pay attention when the lecture finally came to a new point (brain fell a sleep while waiting for something new).",3
64356,"The course content seemed to be rushed out, as a result, the quality is not as good as the first two.",3
64362,A lot of interesting parts of the course are available as optional and a lot of the difficult parts of the coding exercises are provided to you - the challenge is not there. :/,3
64372,The course is interesting and well taught. The professor is very enthusiastic and it makes the course fun to watch. The problem in my opinion is that the content is too superficial. It's completely lack of mathematical background and the programming exercises are sometimes no more than copy paste.,3
64390,"Good, but overemphasizes niche software product (graphlab).",3
64435,"Very overwehelming with lots of names and without explanation, just like real lection in real university.",3
64438,Not the best one on coursera. Included many details that are not really relevant and quizes just checked if you memorized it.,3
64470,average course not too good not too bad,3
64480,"Not bad for refreshing your memory, as in my case - I already received the information while studied in academy, and new key principles but overall memory was shady and needed to be refreshed. But to speedy for a newbie in the area, pace could have been slower.",3
64499,"I rate this 3/5 because of how accurate it looks. I wish it was more practical and that gave some real explanations (not just ""this concept is called like this... because it is called like this""). As I said, anyway, it has a plethora of notions.",3
64508,I miss the slides for static consulting alter the vídeo.,3
64541,"You have to pay to take the the tests. You might as well watch videos on YouTube or better yet get on Khan Academy. I did like the instructor. Even though he takes a while to warm up, he's really good at showing the big picture connections of why things happened.",3
64547,"I am giving this 3 stars for one reason. Although the instructor was terrific and the subject matter interesting, you cannot take the quizzes/tests without purchasing the course (I like to test my retention of the material). As I am an elderly and retired audit-only student and have NO interest in getting a certificate or using the course for college credit, I found that off-putting and dropped the class. Hopefully, other Coursera courses are not going to adopt the same requirement.",3
64548,It does not let it show as completed unless you purchase the course and take the quizzes. Quizzes cannot be taken unless you purchase the course.,3
64620,I believe the assessments focus on insignificant details mentioned in the presentations rather than the big ideas that I believed was the crux of the course.,3
64658,"There is much to praise: nice mapwork, a steady and organized march through time, and some interesting case studies (I especially enjoyed the lecture on Henry Adams).However, the title is a complete misnomer, as the course is regrettably white bread history. I found the approach stale and western-centric, as the content actually covers western Europe and the stretch of its influence through the time period. I also found myself questioning the veracity of many conclusions, as the lecture often had difficulty citing more than a couple specific points of evidence for his arguments.",3
64904,"Some pretty interesting start based on mathematics, but too lengthy obvious advice for someone who gets the concept right away.",3
64916,"There was a lot to try to remember from one quiz to the next and I have memory problems, but if you're a person with normal memory abilities, I guess that wouldn't be a problem. I really enjoyed learning more about ancient Egypt.",3
64924,"Informative course for anyone not familiar with the ancient Egyptians; The quizzes have a low (50%) threshold in order to pass, but are not always easy.",3
64943,"The course was extremely easy. I hoped it would be more of a challenge. No homework, only a 10 questions test every week (that is also extremely easy). As someone who's always been interested in Ancient Egypt, I already knew some things and ended up being able to pass the tests with 90-100% without even following the course. It's really an introduction for people who are pretty much new to the subject, so I'd recommend it, but for people who are looking for something more, you might find it boring. Even though the teacher is nice, the description of the course made me hope that it would be more interesting visually. I mostly read the transcriptions instead of watching the videos, because the teacher would just stand there and talk without moving, and it was not stimulating to me.",3
64968,A very enlightening course ... i would have liked to hear more about the mythology and the gods roles,3
64980,"A very basic overview of Egyptian history, not as detailed as I had expected. It didn't cover as many topics as I would have liked.",3
64995,"The subject is interesting, but the presentation is dry, boring, in monotonous tone. Feels like somebody is reading a text book. No pause between thoughts, no animation of any kind. I am sure, the professor is a great scholar and authority on the subject, but as a lecturer he is not that great. It is unfortunate, because I was eagerly waiting for the course.",3
65048,It is obvious that a lot of effort has been put into producing this course but the assignments were just a bit too difficult. They were too involved and very unforgiving of small mistakes. It took more like 8 or 9 hours of problem solving and debugging and having to try different things and there was one every week so it became pretty frustrating as it really ate into my weekend.,3
65052,"The only setback I had was during the purchase of the course. My amount has been deducted from the bank, but no intimation from this is obtained, neither from Coursera nor Paytm. Please DON'T RUIN YOUR IMAGE because of this. Except for that , This is an excellent course material. Loved going through the videos and assignments. Was equally challenging and FUN to learn RORThanks :)PS : Please initiate the Re-Payment process or at least reply to student's grievances in the Help and Support Forum.",3
65071,This course is really good for Ruby beginners but it doesn't provide enough basic information on Rails framework. The lectures are clear and of a good quality as well as course assignments. The one think I really didn't like is that if you use a new version of Rails you'll have to downgrade. It's not a big problem but new versions bring new functionality and give more power to the developer. But if you don't know Ruby and Rails at all this is a good place to start.,3
65075,"For an introductory course, you really need to move fast and stay focused as there is a large amount thrown at you in a very short time. While this was all very good information, I would much rather have 6-7 at least to spend more time and have more exercises with the code.",3
65099,"This one starts out pretty slow, in fact I had a hard time getting myself excited about working through the material unlike the ML specialization. However, it does get better at the end. Not sure I'm sold on this specialization yet, but we will see after the next course. I think overall from Coursera I'd like to see more interaction and graded programming exercises in between videos to really hammer the concepts home.",3
65100,This is a good course. A thorough introduction to ruby on rails.,3
65102,"1. please the instructor speak loud and clear. As English is not my first language.2. please the instructor and mentor check QA and answer them timely.3.Too many information to understand in 3 weeks of courses, Ruby, Rails, Gem, Bundle, Rspec, Unit Test, Black Box Test, and Food2Fork, Heroku.4. And only 3 weeks the instructor could not make these knowledge areas which I list in point 3 clear. Instructor said that we are not cover this point in this lecture in different lessons several times, so skip over something until this course finished. I suggest that add 2 more weeks to this course.5. I like the assignments from this course, these assignments job help me recall what learned in the courses.",3
65110,"The final module is vague , but the course is nice as a whole",3
65137,It was good but the examples could have been better and there could have been more material. But whatever syllabus was there in this course it was clearly explained,3
65149,"No really what I expected. It's too advanced for a beginner to Ruby and web development but I feel it would be to slow if you read the tutorials and recommended books.When first module and tests are very easy and guide well, but the pace rushes at the end.There's a lot of parts when ""we'll se this later"" is mentioned, which means that maybe the examples are not appropiate for the pace of the course.The little exams and practices are way too easy compared to the week's qualified test. Some parts of the test require to check the documentation or looking in the internet cause it wasnt explained in the videos.After trying some Java, Ruby seems pretty easy but from what I've seen, RoR should be a tool for startup enthusiasts who require easy prototyping and low knowledge of programming/web development.This course is explained as if the students are programmers / web developers that already use tools like github, heroku, unit testing who probably dont require that explanation in first place, but is not deep enough for newcomers.I recommend take a bit more time and include more steps of learning, maybe 1 first course for Ruby before getting into Ruby on Rails. And since is an introduction it should include an installation tutorial. Should I install from repository or a Version Manager (like RVM), the gem concept, what setup do I need, etc.",3
65153,"Very basic introduction. Having said that I couldn't really recommend it to someone without any prior experience. Most concepts were glanced over, for someone without prior experience the material would be too demanding but for people with experience (e.g. me) it was too easy (even though I had no Ruby / Rails experience).",3
65164,it's ok. i would love more practical examples.,3
65173,"A lot of material is presented here which is both good and bad. You will find yourself googling a lot of things as the videos cover certain aspects quite quickly, even some that are important to the assignments.If you have the time to research some of the concepts on your own I say go for it. However, if you don't have much time or you are a complete beginner I would maybe try something else.",3
65177,Good course.,3
65183,Rough around the edges. The assignments are not clear enough. I never got contacted by my mentor and didn't know how to reach out to him either.Content is good.,3
65203,Could've been much more clear with the examples if there were some loads of practice problems,3
65227,"Compared to other courses I have completed on Coursera, this is one of the most confusing ones so far",3
65250,The voice is not good!,3
65258,I struggle sometimes with tests. But after all everything when was good,3
65259,very short course.,3
65267,"Subject matter is excellent, but I feel that the course material had too many trick question for a beginner. Also the lectures would have been more absorbing if they were not just slides with a wall of already inputted code (i.e. a live recording of the coding would have been more informative... like what is done in most other courses)",3
65289,Assignment grading had a lot of technical hurdles. Content on Ruby was solid. Rails coverage was very basic.,3
65315,"Course provides a simple introduction to Ruby. Unlike some others, it requires you to install Ruby from scratch (no VM with preinstalled components) and the final assignment requires you to do a project from scratch as well (no template). This is good and provides a much more real learning experience than some courses. However the bad things are: the deadlines are way too strict; the lectures are way too long and seem to have an unclear structure; technical problems are frequent; a lot of stuff remains poorly explained.",3
65318,Very difficult to follow if you are not a programmer.,3
65343,"Good as introduction, but pretty basic for me.",3
65368,Good introduction to the fieldGood presentersPoor illustrations during courseThank's,3
65389,"I am a PhD student in genetics, so the background material there was review from undergrad courses. Obviously some people who are not biologists will need this background. I do wish, however, that the statistics intro was more applied and covered a better intro and application to the why!",3
65397,"This is an extremely basic course. In my opinion, it isn't worth $49 and is thrown in just to add to the total price of the specialization. It is a useful refresher, but doesn't really contain much information. Just a couple of topics are covered at a very basic level. You could also get this info from watching Youtube videos.",3
65411,"This was a little light, despite the fact that this is not my area of expertise. It was a goo start overall, tho.",3
65432,The course overall has good content. But some videos and case studies were dissapointing in terms of uniqueness of information. You could have easily googled it. Tests could also be more challenging. I would defitenely reccomend it to learners who are new to the industry. For others it could be less informative.,3
65457,"It gives a good idea about this market, although some of the ideas could be more systemized and clear",3
65466,"This course has a very nice content. The difficult thing is to follow the classes with a very difficult language spoken by the teacher. Her English is not so good, although she has a good know-how about the subject but the classes are completely boring and apathetic. What a shame!",3
65487,Very good course but with a few OUTDATED materials.,3
65540,"The content of the course is very interesting, and I plan to go go through with it. A huge downside is that it is very difficult to follow the course because of the professors' strong accent and, at times, incorrect pronunciation. It is distracting. Also, it would be good to have weekly assignments, to stay on track.",3
65550,The module was alright but I got bored halfway through,3
65551,"Course is interesting, but sometimes its so hard to perceive the information with such accent :( I`m not lazy to read the subtitles, no.. but they also, from time to time work improperly and its not feasible at all to conceive the information . Plus, its absolutely inconvenient when you provide one huge assignment for several weeks at once! Why couldn`t you make it a few smaller to every week?(( I think I`ll disenroll",3
65566,"The course content of this course is not much and thus one can finish it rather very quickly. However one of the lecturer's had such a heavy accent I had to use subtitles just to understand the content. I am not in anyway in the fashion industry nor aspiring to be so this was just like a ""tester"" for me. I was however surprised that its not all about modelling and the sorts but incorporates some business aspect about the fashion industry.",3
65600,"Problems with translation from Spanish to English creating confusion to non - Spanish students. Not all the lectures are translated. I have noticed that some English translation is missing or is incorrect.Also, since I am a non - Spanish student I can not review correctly and accordingly Spanish posted assignments due to language barriers.",3
65603,"Too fast speech/ language use in combination with poor english translation, otherwise pretty well done.",3
65604,"1. Sometimes the audio of the recordings is poor, making it difficult to listen.2. For non-speakers of Spanish, the translations are not so great and sometimes lack proper grammar or are almost literal translations of the spoken Spanish version. This makes the subject matter, although very interesting, very difficult to fully grasp. This also occurs in the quizzes, causing me to either misunderstand or not understand the questions.Overall, it is a very interesting course but the 'execution' is not up to standard. It could be improved by updating the audio recordings, and correcting the translations for the subtitles",3
65605,The course material was good but the lectures being in Spanish with English translations was difficult to follow. I was disappointed in the short videos with subtitles.,3
65660,"i would like to see some subtitles in Spanish, to help me understand much better the main idea ! but in generally is so good and helpful!",3
65682,It is interesting and mind opening during the beginning and the middle of the course. Learned some interesting principle.,3
65785,"It's good for undergraduates, and people returning to academia (say, before starting a Master's course). It's a very short simple introduction. I kind of wish it had more examples of language to use in academic writing, contrasting good and bad examples.Some of the quiz questions and final exam questions need some proofreading. The videos from about week 3 to 4 have poor sound quality, but still understandable.",3
65789,"The course contains useful writing tips, but severly lacks practical writing assignments (peer-review assessment would be great here!). The quizzes are way too easy, IMO.",3
65794,"The course provides a number of very useful tips for researchers, especially those whose first language is not English. There are a number of useful guides for new researchers to learn how to structure, phrase, and approach academic writing. However, there are also a few shortcomings of the course. Some of the material is overly subjective (giving rules for academic writing that are not necessarily applicable). Many of the assessment questions ask about issues which are either overly specific or simply incorrect (this is a very small percentage, but it is noticeable). The pace of the videos is also slow and oddly punctuated to the point that it can be difficult to follow at times. Finally, the course relies too heavily on academic writing for the hard sciences, rather than taking a broader approach, so some students may wish to keep this in mind when watching, as some advice may not be applicable to their own discipline.Overall, a recommended course for ESL academics, but could do with some improvement.",3
65802,"Intended for Non-native English speakers, or English speakers without a strong literary background, 'Scholarly Communication' gives an overview of how to construct coherent arguments for academic publication.There are multiple typos and presentation issues throughout the course; however, they do not necessarily detract from the content of the course.",3
65804,"This is a useful course, but please look into the spelling and grammatical errors in the text.",3
65827,"In my opinion, this course was way too theoretical. I wish we had more examples and practical exercises. After four courses in a row I was expecting much more skills rather than theoretical discussions all the way long.",3
65848,"Certain aspects of the course could be improved, particularly in the way the material is presented. There could also be more focus on what is important rather than unnecessary etymologies and listing of names which doesn't add to any conceptual understanding. That time could rather be used to go into more depth with some of the practices.https://evidenceandreason.wordpress.com/2017/01/29/review-magic-in-the-middle-ages/",3
65851,"Overall a good course, with a section on Islam and Magic that felt very well elaborated. All peer graded exercises however were poorly designed and had awful correction criteria.",3
65884,"It is a very interesting course, but in the beginning it may seem a bit disorganised and slow. The best part, for me, was the week 4, about magic in Islam. The topic was fascinating and the teachers presented a perfect lecture, a great balance between deep but easy to follow.",3
65916,"The professor has a tone of voice that is a little monotonous, but it was interesting to learn about memory with movies",3
65947,"I liked this course for the wide range of movie excerpts which underscored a memory malfunction. The scenes were often emotional, quite surprising such a short moment could be so charged.However the main emphasis of this memory module was to explore malfunctioning memory, to the side of pathology. This was done professionally without a doubt. However this was not what I personally was looking for although one learns about dementia, alzheimer, etc, which is interesting as they will affect most of us in someway or another.",3
65968,"This ""should be"" a five star course. It is a great topic, with wonderful clips from movies and is well-written.Why only 3 stars then?For a class about film little was adopted from good storytelling and filming techniques. The Prof slumped in his chair and clasped his hands in front of his chest for most of the course and spoke in a wispy, pedantic voice that made me uncomfortable in my body to listen to. I kept on wanting to tell him to sit up and breath and speak naturally! On top of that, the sound quality was simply awful!If the Prof were to take some acting or presenting lessons and improvements to the sound quality were made (or a professional actor hired to present the material) it could be one of the best courses ever, but instead, it was hard to get through for me even though the material fascinates me as I'm learning neuroscience and love movies.The world of MOOCs are different than your old standard classroom style. Visual and auditory presentation really counts.",3
66000,"I appreciate the effort that went into making this course as well as obtaining the film clips. Having said that, if you want to go deeper into the psychology of memory this course is probably not for you. As I progressed through the weeks, I found myself becoming less and less interested since I already know the basics of memory and psychology. I felt I wasn't learning anything new but the clips of films allowed me to see the films in a new light. Maybe if I had bought the book that goes along with the course, i would have gained more insight but as a standalone course, it rates just three stars.",3
66091,Not that interesting,3
66164,"Interesting topic, however the course lacks practical side.",3
66196,"Course deals with many interesting theories about motivation, leadership, teamwork and culture. However, it lacks practical examples and case studies (there is only one in the last week). I liked the required reading material, but I did not find videos very engaging.",3
66204,"It is theoretical, which is nice, but more practical example like case study would have kindled my interest to go for the certificate.",3
66205,its a good course but have some problems in the quizzes,3
66294,"I would have enjoyed it more if I had had enough knowledge to do the Honors quiz!I downloaded all the videos so I could play them over without chewing up my data, but the quality is so poor you can't always make out the writing - i's and j's all look similar. It would be better if the presentation material was bigger and the facilitator images smaller - you need only see a face, not the whole upper body in the foreground.Nevertheless, I have been enlightened !",3
66300,"Week 1 on Technical SEO was hard. Also, I don't have subscriptions to the various tools but it might be useful for future reference. It was too technical for me. Week 2 on Global SEO was already covered in an earlier course by Mrs. May. Week 3 on Mobile SEO was very insightful. Great! Learning about metrics (week 4) is always useful, so five stars for weeks 3 and 4.",3
66346,Informative,3
66355,The composition and visual elements part of the course was incredible but the Lightroom part could be improved. Going through every feature in Lightroom is not helpful. It's better to focus on teaching key useful techniques to achieve desired effects,3
66364,This course seemed a bit spread too thin. Not much real coverage on post-production; mostly just an intro and that was at the expense of more learning on composition.,3
66448,Thanks for writing the new feature about the java8 for free.But for most lessons it is too easy to learn.,3
66450,"Unique and useful course. However some of the material needs adjustment, search strategy related material especially. It is introduced too late in the course, when homework needed it is all done with, and in my opinion there isn't enough pedagogic content on the subject. MiniZinc docs are quite minimal, so supporting material would be helpful.",3
66498,"This course is really, well, introductory. While the material presented is interesting, the lectures can be quite dull at times - especially later on in the course when substantial time is spent plugging numbers into the same expressions 3 or 4 times. Beginners will probably be better off reading a wikipedia article or any general chemistry textbook. For the others, setting the playback speed to 1.50 improves the quality of the course a lot.",3
66517,"Although the course offers a very wide range of subjects and also additional recommendations for reading, the basic didactic material superficially explores the work of each artist. I am sure that MoMA team has the capacity to offer a deeper content.",3
66545,"This course takes an alternate approach to understanding modern Art, moving it away from categories based on the time period in which art was made or what school the artist was part of and instead groups art work by theme. I really enjoyed all the pieces I encountered and felt like I had a somewhat better understanding of modern art after taking this course.",3
66550,Interesting and thought provoking course BUT the peer assignment tasks and evaluation criteria are moving targets that seem to be very hard to hit per my own experience and the discussion forums. Also what if you do not totally agreed with the IDEA that thematic presentation of art is the way that modern art has to be presented. And find themes as more of a way for art institutions to promote their own agendas and longevities. Which again is nothing new in the presentation of art but also can meander away from the artists' and art works' intent!,3
66553,"I very much enjoyed the setup of the course, that is the short introduction and then the discussion of different artworks per theme. However, I must say that I expected the course to be more thorough in the discussion of the different themes and artworks. I believe the course would benefit from a more in depth discussions of the artworks. This could for example include more background information about the artist or a comparison of different pieces by the same artist to better understand the artists' views and development through history. Such additions would elevate the level of the course and also help identify certain themes and events that often recur in art. To conclude, it was a very enjoyable course that help grasp basic concepts of modern art.",3
66570,"Very highlever, i would have enjoyed more technique to understand art",3
66572,"I have taken many courses on Coursera now, and I've enjoyed and learned a lot from most of them, but I have to admit I was disappointed with this one, despite having a deep interest in modern art and art theory. Here are some of my criticisms:1. The course is aimed at teachers and art educators, which was not made at all clear on the course info page, apart from a single reference to the 'pedagogical framework'. If I'd understood this, I may well not have enrolled.2. I found the course very basic, with no consideration of art theory beyond a level appropriate for classroom discussion. This is in contrast to many other Coursera courses, which have been pitched at graduate level or above. I don't really feel like I learned anything on this course.3. The video lectures are very short and uninformative, but the weekly reading list is very long and much more time consuming that the actual tuition. I would have preferred a better balance between tutorials and reading.4. The weekly quizzes were very short (six questions, where other courses typically have 20 to 30 questions per module), and and questions focus almost entirely on the pedagogical set texts, with very little attention paid to the art history or the works discussed in the tutorials. If you are not going to be tested on the material, what is the point of all that required reading?5. The final peer-assessed assignment is lacking in instructions or guidance. For example, you are required to upload images of 3 or 4 artworks and discuss them. It is in fact impossible to upload more than a single image, but there are no instructions on what to do about this. People found various workarounds - uploading pdfs or Word documents, or zipped folders of images, but really, there should be some official guidance on this.6. Comments made when assessing other students' work are not anonymous - this is unique in my Coursera experience, where anonymous marking is the norm, and knowing how fractious people can get when they are disappointed with their grade, I am not at all happy about having my name made available to them.Overall, the only reason I persisted with this course is that I wanted to get a certificate with MoMA written on it. Too bad I couldn't have actually learned something as well.",3
66574,Mostly a guide for teachers bringing classes to MOMA; weak otherwise.,3
66584,"I've learned about some paintings and object, but the format of the course was weak. Should have stuck with the historical progression of Modern Art--tried and true approach.",3
66629,"I have no complaints over the content. I would however, change the final quizzes, which rely too much on one essay rather than on the videos or on other reading material.",3
66632,"This course is designed for school teachers and, perhaps, for art museum's workers. I'm neither, but I took this course because I'd like to know more about the modern art.The course is essentially a merge of two independent parts, namely, videos about artworks and papers about different theories of education in art. I took this course because of artworks, so I was not interested in papers.Videos were great; especially the first one in each lesson. Even my husband, who isn't fond of art in general, found these videos interesting. In videos, lecturer explains history and meaning of each piece of art.Required reading was dramatically different. First, students are required to read at least 10 pages (art papers) about approaches in teaching AND at least 4 articles in museum's website PER WEEK. Actually, careful reading not just browsing does take a lot of time, in fact, it takes way more time per week than claimed. In addition, these reading were not useful for me! I am not interested in teaching art, and reading same facts about artworks that I've heard in lectures is waste of my time. Seriously, I and most of people grasp most of the ideas from the first time; even if not, I would watch the video again. Why should I do extra reading that brings me no extra knowledge?On a good side, one can pass quiz without any reading. Just a bit of thinking process, and you pass with 5/6 or 6/6 score.Overall, the course is attractive because of amazing videos. However, I believe that this course must be reorganized in two different courses - one would be about artworks and understanding of art, another would be about teaching techniques in art.",3
66654,Excellent concepts and content. Poor quiz composition and monitoring by MOMA staff of discussion. Logistical hassles tainted joy from the delivery.,3
66656,there were mistakes in the quizzes.,3
66657,"The information, videos, links additional reading do provide important information. However this course is aimed at teachers and that is not clear from the title and much less with the small amount of articles that are related to teaching. This course also has lots of issues with its quizzes; getting no support from staff on technical matters or feed back on why a true or false questions is always wrong.",3
66739,"Several errors on the correction of exercises, not so deep material about the statistical analysis.",3
66751,I posted a question on the last week on the forum and never received an answer from a mentor. I had one response from another student which did not actually address the issue of my question and I had several views. And it wasn't as if there were a lot of questions posted. One course mentor could have easily answered all of them.,3

66805,"Although better than the previous course, it still was not very insightful. I wanted to know the components of the Integrated plan and not how someone was successful. Majority of the class was just copy from Stokes book. You can take that book and learn it yourself. The style of teaching does not really challenge or give insight.",3
66808,"The course material could have been better....Instructor was just reading out content, more practical example and case studies could be a part of content.",3
66809,It is very basic and boring. Really you can spend 5 min Googling the things you learn on this course.,3
66817,"Unlike the previous courses within this Digital Marketing Specialization, this one seemed more ""superficial"" in terms of concepts and, specially, of materials provided: presentation videos and slides covered only the essential topics and were often repetitive. Considering this is the last step to the Capstone Project, I had greater expectations for it.",3
66820,"The course was taken almost literally from the text book Emarketing by Rob Stokes, so the input given by the teacher was not quite relevant. Although the text book was an excellent tool.",3
66823,The course depended in big proportion of the material of Rob Stokes. It's OK to make the process as Stokes suggest but I think you can put more of yourself.,3

66968,"I have met part of my goals of taking this program. Thank you Prof. Mathias Finger. I would recommend it to be more data oriented like those case studies with specific examples so that it naturally converges to creating case study for a city at the end of the course as final project rather than optional study. Also, suggest to reduce discussions centred to challenges (the course has taken too much of time) and more towards different new services adopted by different cities to capture benefits/impact to the city GDP.",3

67040,Not very motivating lectures.. Too much talk but lacks the essential clarity,3
67044,"The course is super interesting. However, the lectures could be better explained and the material better organized. I found myself constantly looking online for extra material to better understand the concepts. Also, you can tell that the course is not anymore groomed and there are some mistakes in a quiz due to lack of care. In any case, the course is very recommendable to start with neural networks",3
67048,"I recommend this course for theoretical knowledge only. I was very upset with the programming assignments - they are few, they are not consistent in difficulty level and the way they being checked is not convenient.",3
67051,"I learned quite a lot that I can use for research, personal projects, and general understanding of neural networks, but unfortunately this course is getting quite out of date at this point. I would recommend to others looking for a first course in neural networks (for machine learning applications) look for a newer course.",3
67054,"The course contains basic informations on neural networks at a quite abstract level. It is not enough to easily understand them without a prior preperation in mathematical details. The quizzes need strict computations based on a detailed knowledge, but usually the course does not prepare You for that. The lectures sometimes sound ""babble"" and cannot explain even easy things.It is usually impossible to get the minimum of 80% in a quiz. These are only those who have previous knowledge that can pass it the first time they take it. They do not need this course, though.",3
67056,"The lectures have basically no training or necessary teachings for the math needed for the quizzes. You spend way more time looking for resources about how to answer the quiz questions than the lectures will take to review. Even then you only given the necessary breakdown of the math involved after you answer the question correctly, which doesn't help in anyway when you are stuck.All this course did for me was help me find other courses which do a better job of going over the course materials.",3
67076,Very out of date.,3
67092,"The course is an advanced one and not really suggested for a beginner who would want to understand basic concepts.

67129,good overview but not up to date and some errors in quizes,3
67130,I liked the content of this course and for the most part I thought it was pretty decent. I just felt that the lectures needed a bit more structure since there didn't seem to be a very good transition between topics. The some of the quiz questions in this course were broken since they were missing details that we crucial to answering the questions (missing weights or having wrong answers since the posted values didn't align with the answer).,3
67140,"You can get many knowledge from this course, but you have to be prepared. Actually learning course gives me no pleasure. It is not complete, you have to guess many things and find additional materials somewhere else to pass all course quizzes and assignments. BTW some quizzes are invalid. I think there was some issues while migrating to updated coursera version, that is why some course materials lost.",3
67154,"I have mixed feelings about this course. On one hand, scope is ambitious and getting to attend a course by G Hinton is a luxury. On the other hand, some topics are addressed confusingly (e.g. Hopfield Nets) or without going into much detail. But I think the worst of this course, and I wish Coursera would take care of that, is some quizzes being completely broken (missing or incorrect data), forcing you to go to Forums to get the correct question.There are big gaps of data and no course biography to follow or complete the missing gaps (lecture resources, when available, is just papers on the topic). Also, the course would benefit from better programming exercises... as it stands it is just ""download a program, complete a couple of methods, fill in the gaps on a quiz""",3
67162,Excellent content and overview of the field. Appreciated the links to journal papers as extensions to the lecture notes. Course is let down somewhat by lecture notes that skim the surface too much to really be useful and outright errors in quizzes and assignments that will hinder completion unless you read through every forum post to find the missing information. (Quiz 13 was the worst offender).,3
67166,It lacks programming assignments and a base for understanding the algorithms exposed.,3
67178,interesting history of neural networks and excellent coverage of all main architectures.couple of problems during the quizzes. An update is needed!,3
67181,"The course is a bit disorganized and could have been better. While the topics are really interesting and Geoffrey is really knowledgeable, a lot of simple concepts have been made seemly complicated from the way they have been presented -- often requiring external follow up studies (and often discovering in surprise how simple they actually are). such as, contrastive divergence (CD1) algorithm to train Restricted Bolazamann Machine (read wikipedia to get it in under 2 mins), functioning of sigmoid belief net etc. I believe, the issue arises from slides based teaching, where a slide of texts is presented and then there is a long monologue of how that system works from start to end. A more useful approach would have been to actually draw-and-talk (good example of such courses are Machine Learning by Andrew Ng, Game Theory (esp. Kevin Leyton-Brown parts). Nonetheless, the course brings forth a lot of Neural Net topics and is definitely worth taking if you are willing to study outside the course also.",3
67210,"The material is not presented in a cohesive manner. In video questions are not very good and don't make sense often. Since this is the only course of its kind on coursera, you don't have many options either. The material seems very arbitrary and even with a basic knowledge of machine learning, and advanced mathematics it is difficult to understand the first week and the types of neurons presented, understanding which is essential I think.",3
67217,"The content of this course is not self-contained. You need to search and read extra materials to fill some knowledge gaps. Besides, some of the videos are missing and some quiz are not well clarified. Well, given all the complaints, the instructor is of no doubt one of the best in this field. The topics in this course is worth exploring using your own time.",3
67224,"This course is good, unique and relevant for machine learning today. Some things can be improved though. Starting around weeks 11-12 the lectures become a bit vague, and I had quite some difficulty understanding them. It seemed to me that these lectures were hastily created (even though I can only imagine how much work creating this course must have been). Furthermore, the lab sessions are rather easy and the provided code is annoying to work with systematically since they output results as printed text instead of something re-usable. This makes experimentation (like grid searches) a bit tedious. Besides these minor things, the course is quite good.Note that deep learning topics are only briefly touched, but you won't obtain the skills for training and designing them yourself without further exploration of the topics.Finally, many thanks to the teachers!",3

67275,"This is a good course, and I would (indeed, have) recommend it to others.However the week on science seemed to lack any references that i could find; unless i'm missing the obvious. If there were none included then this is not acceptable when discussing science in an academic context. If they are there somewhere then i think the course as a whole would be improved by making them more apparent. Perhaps by putting the references for a lecture at the end of the lecture, where there is already a slide giving credit for the use of images. This is basic practice when lecturing on science generally.Either way I'm loving the course and thank you for producing it!",3

67418,"Advantages:1) I liked the idea of filming the lectures of Dr Seligman in the real class. Watching his videos, I felt like I was sitting is the lecture room with other students.2) I also enjoyed watching different researchers talking about their fields of study. Inviting different speakers makes the course more diverse.Areas of improvement:1) Design. Some of the presentations in the videos were not in the style of the course (e.g. videos on constructive journalism)2) Structure. The overall impression is that different parts of the course were not reconciled with each other, leading to fragmentation of the course. It concerns not only design, but also video lenght (for example videos on constructive journalism were way too long) and lack of a sigle thread going through all the videos and supplementary materials. It seems that the course has been made in a hurry.",3
67437,"I rather liked the material and its delivery. Another thing I liked very much was students' commitment and achievements as exposed in the peer-reviewed assignments. What I disliked was abundance of personal-computer slang in the language of the professor, jamming all the peer-reviewed assignments into only two weeks and the incident with broken APA style.Despite my criticisms mentioned, I am grateful to the professor, HSE and Coursera staff, and my classmates for the opportunity and experience!",3

So got my certificate after a bit of struggle.I'm planning to see other online materials related to week 4 and week 5 , as couldn't completely understand from this one. If you can modify those two weeks, it would be great. I hope you continue the great work of illuminating millions of young people's interests through your great courses and organization. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.",3
67530,This specific course traded off depth and detail for breadth of topics. Too many ideas were quickly described and not really built up to my liking.,3
67543,"Feels like this course in the specialization was a bit rushed, compared to the first 3 courses. It had 2 modules (first & last) that were more like placeholders and the middle 4 modules went from concept to the maths behind the algorithm very quickly. It needs a bit of work on expanding the course and presenting a bit more slowly. Having said all that, the concepts and algorithms taught are very interesting and a good first step into the unsupervised learning section.",3
67558,"Overall a good and useful course, however:A) They could do a much better job regarding LDA, standard Gibbs sampling, and Bayesian model and inference. Many slides on these 3 topics only contained some text and the instructor tried to ""verbally"" visualize the related important concepts. Hence not a good use of a video session.B) Week 1 and the 1st half of Week 6 were redundant.C) It would be much better to have a 7-week course with more topics and may be with some optional videos on Bayesian model, HMM.",3

The clustering part was going well until it reached LDA.The LDA module is very poorly covered, and also very hard to understand. I had to watch the videos more than two times to try to figure out what was LDA, and a Quora article posted in the Forum could explain it much better.Then we get to the Hierarchical Clustering module, which was the most poorly module in all this specialization. There is only one video talking about HMM models, and Markov Chains deserve at least one week to even get started with it. And to complete, there is just one Assignment with only 3 questions.The specialization was going perfect until now. I am very disappointed with this course. I hope the last two courses are much better covered and not just ran over like this this one was.",3

I believe the concepts are explained in a clear manner but they are too high-level to be considered ""learning"". By the end of the course you will be familiar with some concepts of ML and the Graphlab API, but you won't be ready to implement anything by your own. However, I think this course is good to evaluate whether you like the teaching style and the overall style of the specialization. It would be nice to be able to skip this course and still get the specialization completed. if you already know what you want to learn and you don't want the the full specialization certificate jump into the other courses right away.

68210,The only reason that I am giving 3 star is the design of the quizzes for each week. The readings are too long and the content of the quiz sometimes gets you frustrated!,3
68227,"not using scikit and assigment way too easy, not challenging, but high quality video, very easy to understand .",3
68232,"I enjoyed the course and I will continue with the specialization. I am giving a 3-star rating as i) the lectures need to be updated with correct data or need to provide guidance as to when one should expect individual difference when following along with the notebook, ii) instructor / mentor response in the discussion forums is lacking, iii) graphlab is now an outdated tool as it is not commercially available.",3
68245,"This was a valuable introductory survey course. For me, the challenge came from my unfamiliarity with Python not the material. I would rate this class as ""entry level"" for anybody with a college-level technical degree.",3
68260,thanks to prof and cousera for this wonderful course. I wish the programming part was taught separately from basic. I have taken the previous course which was case study approach with respect to which it was slightly tough.,3
68261,The Professors and the lectures were excellent. Homeworks are way to easy. Would like to use open source tools like pandas and sci-kit learn instead of proprietary tools like graphlab.,3
68281,"Some instructions of the programming assignments are not all that clear, which wasted me a lot of time.",3
68329,"Professors are very good , i am really enjoy in this class, but no further discussion about implementing ML algorithm, just call the API to handle the sort of data.",3
68344,"The course is effectively a tutorial on how to use proprietary software to solve a range of machine learning problems.I liked the fact that the course covered a wide range of problems quickly. There were however two issues that I did not like.1) It is not well supported and given that the technology is proprietary, there are few other places that offer support (i.e. you can’t just look at problems and solutions on stackoverflow to get insight into the tech)2) For a course labelled as “intermediate”, it presented very little detail. Most of the course was dedicated to explaining particular problems, the solution to which was inevitably “then you train this really clever, one-line algorithm we have written for you and you query it for insights”. I felt a little cheated by this approach to a subject which should be really fascinating.While some of my concerns may be addressed in follow on courses, I am left with little insight into what really lies ahead. For example, is this really an “intermediate” course? What background do I really need? Will we ever get to the detail or will I always just be expected to call someone else’s brilliant algorithm and accept the result.",3
68350,"Pros:(1) Teachers know what they are talking.(2) They are energetic and funny.Cons:(1) The course uses proprietary and expensive tool.(2) The course is too simplistic.(3) The teachers, although they know what they are talking about, they aren't very good at teaching.",3
68357,"While I am aware that this is an overview of the other courses in the specialization, I felt that the quizzes and programming exercises didn't really get into the actual topic. For example the recommender systems quiz and programming assignment have nothing about factorization except a single superficial question. The material is clear and the overview is nice, but the practical part let me down.",3
68384,"Nice overview of the specialization. Since it aims at showing the advanced and interesting things you will learn during the specialization, some of the practical sessions are way too advanced. Thus, for me felt more like a mechanical copying of what the instructors did rather than an actual assessment of what I understood. Also, since some of the applications are actually repeated at the beginning of the main courses, it feels like a repetition somehow when then you move to the specialized courses.",3
68423,The enthusiasm of the instructors was the best thing about this class. But I really wanted a more rigorous methodology - and didn't really get it here. But it was an alright introduction to machine learning but not enough if you want to know what makes the 'black box' work.,3
68468,"The instructors are great and the material logically detailed. The only problem is feed back or lack thereof. The assignments are hard for a person who has minimal computer skills as described in the outline, so having someone to go to for questions, especially the programming parts are essential and this is lacking unfortunately. Apparently, and I don't want to put words in someone else's mouth, but the assumption is that the fellow students will have the missing information and that they will actually answer them. That is not the case unfortunately. So even though I emailed the instructors with no response, I managed to obtain some information from other student who were extremely dedicated and much more advanced. I may have entered the course at a minimal personnel time which may account for my perceived difficulty. However, from some of the griping, I am not alone. On the other one gets what they pay for and I was overall glad to take the course and respect all the aspects except for the one already mentioned.",3
68474,Get ready for a course that assumes you have all the software they use already installed without advanced notice or instructions!,3
68484,"Generally ok. Towards the end of the course, the lectures could have been a bit more in depth - or provide students with a more in depth reading list.",3
68487,"The course could have been marked by 5 stars if it weren't for the promotion of a commercial Python library developed by one of the speakers. There is no way a student could complete the course without having Python installed and a free licence acquired from dato.com.Students should be able to use any programming languages and scientific libraries to do their homework and the subsequent courses of the ""Machine Learning"" specialisation are excellent examples of such approach.",3
68493,Could go a little more in detail on the algorithms.,3
68495,It is a very simple course.,3
68505,"I think this course is a relatively well put together, gentle introduction to machine learning. It would be good for people with zero experience with ML, who might be overwhelmed by other ML courses (Ng, Abu-Mostafa) out there. This course would not be useful for anyone who has any previous knowledge of ML.Many reviewers have taken issue with the software used. I actually liked the Dato libraries a lot, but I'd be uncomfortable using proprietary software for research. I thought it was friendly enough to be appropriate for this kind of intro class, and I really enjoy iPython notebooks for interactive teaching.I rated this course a 3 because of the price for the full course. This part of the specialization should be free. It does not provide enough instruction, practice, or content for the cost. Multiple choice quizzes are used to grade the programming assignments, so there is no feedback from the instructors. These answers are not made available to students in the free tier, which flies in the face of open learning. I am disappointed in the recent push to monetize courses. Please don't pay for this one.",3
68506,"The course content is great. It gives overview on what is going to be learned in details in the next courses. Considering that it is an introductory course and the fact that it utilizes the GraphLab library as tool, I believe it is overpriced compared to the other courses of the specialization.",3
68516,Nice introductory course but too much dependence on graphLab create,3
68531,"It's not a bad course, but it forces students to use GraphLab, a framework created by one the professors teaching the course, instead of using scikit-learn, a widely used framework for machine learning in Python.",3
68542,"It should be 5 stars based on content - though I have a feeling it's a bit dragged out to create as many courses as possible for the Speclialisation.However, I think IPython isn't a great tool for this, especially as the requirement is Python 2.7 for GraphLab as it doesn't support Python 3 yet. Going backwards, I think. I also think ideally you would want to encourage people to write bigger chunks of code rather than get bogged down with word counting.However, the main issue is that the assignments are really badly put together. It's actually hard to understand what the underlying requirements are at first read - from about Week 3 onwards. The concepts are easy to understand, it's the way they are worded and jumbled. I had to read them over and over again because there is a fair amount of jumping around and since there is filtering of the data, the order you carry out the tasks matter very much.I was looking forward to this course and planned to take 3 but now I regret paying for this one and thinking about finding another one. I think the tool and the messiness of the assignment make this Specialisation not up to the task, sorry.",3
68552,"I think it was a good introductory course. However, I think it was too simple: assignments required no more than copy+paste from the lectures.I understand the primary goal is to hook people up on how good graphlabs is, but I'd rather leaarn numpy, sklearn and other widely available tools. At least show both in the leactures. Please :)",3
68563,"The course is ok, the instruction was very poor for the deep learning section of the course.",3
68584,"Really just an overview of the topics to be explained in detail afterwards.Big plus for the use of python + notebooks but otherwise, if one is interested just in the overview and not in all the specialization, maybe the Andrew NG course is more detailed.",3
68600,"This course is for you if you really don't know anything about Machine Learning and nothing about Python. If you do know something about it, look for a different course.I learned the most from lesson 5 and 6 about recommenders and deep learning because I knew nothing about these subjects.The programming exercises are disappointing: just cut and paste. I found this demotivating.",3
68653,"I did not have a lot of experience in machine learning, so this course was very good in the aspect of introducing people to machine learning concepts. Most of the times the material was very well explained, and I like the concept of the tutor writing on the screen at the same time they are presenting, personally it helps me more. Some of the quizzes were easy so you did not need a lot of preparation, some of them were more difficult or troublesome, like the quiz for Deep Learning. I also liked the graphlab module, I think that learning how to use it will help me with my own work.However, as this course does not really go in depth in the algorithms themselves, I feel that after one month and a half I have a basic idea, but I haven't learned much about how to implement machine learning on my own even in basic things, while other courses have more or less the same time frame and are more dense in their material. In my opinion, this whole introductory course would just be just splitted and each of these intrductory weeks would be appended as the first week of the subsequent modules to come. Because anyways, after 4 months in the specialization, if somebody continues to the recommender systems module for example, he/she would have forgotten the basics of this so they would need to cover again the recommender systems week in this course. And from the other hand, if some introduction is again repeated in the subsequent modules, then why have this introductory course anyways?Thanks.",3
68657,All algorithms were black boxed. It was a nice course on how to use Dato's GraphLab and an overview of ML concepts.,3
68658,"I don't like this course , because the homework can not match the lesson. I can not got more messages to completed the homework.So I will Unregister this courser , Thanks.",3
68663,"The lectures are fine. However the content is way too easy. Another course on Coursera `Mining Massive DataSets` is much better, in the depth and horizon.",3
68664,"Having almost completed this course, I can say that this course provides a basic over view of the concepts of ML. Quality and content are lacking. The professors, breeze thru the concepts in few short videos. No further guidance is available. You are on your own.While the quizzes test the concepts learned, no live help is available. Again, you are on your own.1. Some course materials should be provided other than basic fancy power point slides. The lectures don't do justice to the material content and quizzes. Some reference materials or write ups would be greatly helpful.2. Teaching assistants or moderators should be made available for each course to help out with any conceptual or programmatic questions. Students are left to collaborate amongst themselves and figure out a solution. For a paid course, I expect some real professional help.Many a times, I had to turn to google to help me out if I was stuck at a problem or didnt understand a concept. If googling was the only option, then I do not see a value in this course.I doubt if I will continue the other courses in this specialization.Thanks!",3
68670,"Pretty high level overview. I guess it's necessary to give a roadmap for where the concentration leads, but I wonder if each lesson couldn't have been added in its respective module, or if at least the Foundations Module couldn't be shortened a little - or alternatively made a bit more challenging. I'm on the first real module now and the change in difficulty is quite significant.",3
68681,"I think that the course is redundant, it is to general, trying to capture to much, and using a commercial program tool that's doing to much behind the scene.The second course in the specialization is really great though and you wont miss anything if you skip ahead",3
68769,"would vastly prefer if this was taught using sckit-learn and pandas, given their broader use.",3
68771,"The concept and overall material covered was exciting. However, the lessons often did not connect to what was actually being tested. This course requires a lot of reading of the Dato SFrame manual. If the instructors focused more on showing how to actually do some of the tested material, I would've given this course four to five stars. At the end of the day, this course does give an entry level data scientist such as myself the ability to do some 'cool' analysis, which I truly appreciated. Overall, I would recommend this course to a fellow data scientist. I just hope the instructors focus on teaching content with more focus and clarity.",3
68779,Decent course. Not very satisfied with the assignments as they are suited for graphlab,3
68817,Gives a really broad overview of ML concepts. Examples (and assignments) use a commercial Dato product called (GraphLab Create). Expect nothing else.,3
68818,This course has so much potential but is based on proprietary software. The instructors are excellent and the content is really good. It would get 5 stars if it was based on all open source software.,3
68856,"The biggest downside of the course is that instead of learning on open source machine learning modules (sklearn) the course offers Dato's GraphLab, a proprietary piece of software that requires paid licenses to operate.To be clear, during the duration of the course students can use a student license that provides graphlab for free but this expires after a year. It seems like fine software but if you arent going to purchase a license after the class expires whats the point? Also, Graphlab is built on top of python2.7. If you are running python 3.0+ on your machine youll have to install a python 2.7 instance.Otherwise the quality is solid. The philosophical approach the professors take is to give you a taste of a variety of machine learning models. The upside is that if you want to get a taste you can. The downside the course feels pretty shallow and then the next course in the specialization -- regression -- feels like a pretty stark contrast. In general it could be argued that this is a problem with all coursera courses. How do you modulate course difficulty when you could be targeting students who are somewhere between high school kids to computer scientists? So the course and the specialization tilts between very easy and very hard.",3
68865,"Not a bad course, but extremely basic. Was expecting more.",3
68886,I really liked the fact that we were given an overview of all the machine learning techniques before we actually delve deeper. However I would have rather appreciated it further if we used open source python libraries rather than graphlab!I think the use of graphlab really did limit our scalability and use elsewhere other than on the course.Please do consider using open source tools in further courses and also provide starter code for the assignments in one open source library in addition to the code provided using graphlab.,3
68923,"Lectures are very easy and unnecessarily long and slow. I had to watch all of them on x2 playback speed to not die of boredom. Also, what is the point of breaking them into 3 minute chunks? Some people may need more time just for getting to the right mood to learn. I cannot imagine anyone watching 3 minute video, doing something else and returning back to it. Also, it requires me to start the next video and set the speed to x2 again.Overall, lectures are OK and material is explained well.Programming assignments are worthless, as they are basically ""Fill one line of code that does X. By the way, here is the syntax. And here is the data to use."" No thinking required.",3
68946,"I am giving this course 3 stars for a few reasons:1) (Negative) Essentially no instructions were given for how to get Graphlab to actually work in Python outside of the notebook. I already have python on my computer, but the course basically only explains ipython notebook.2) (Negative) I think the course would be a lot better if it didn't use this pretty graphical interface of ipython notebook. Why use this? I feel like this was done to dumb things down so that more people with no programming knowledge could get by. In reality it just makes everyone learn less. Using python normally, with graphlab imported, would be much better.3) (Positive) The lectures on things other than ipython notebook were fairly good, and I like how the specialty is structured with case studies.",3
69005,"Too much synthetic on very important parts, too much focused on graphlab",3
69020,Good course to begin machine learning with but it's too easy !!,3
69038,Too easy,3
69051,I think this is an excellent course. I would have given 5 stars if this course is not based on Graphlab which is not affordable to the general public.,3
69060,"Recently, I got a certification of Machine Learning course of Anderw Ng.So the first course of Machine Learning Specialization is too easy for me.But I think it's not a matter of how easy it is.This program poorly explain how algorithms workEven if the lecturers keep saying that we are going to study in detail in the later courses,it's very difficult to stand boring situations.And there's a serious problem.They provide data for programming assignments, which shows different results compared to the one in the video lectures. So I am soooooooooo confused.There are some small hardships more. But I am stopping writing this.If at least one of the lecturers find my review, please contact me.",3
69071,"The video lectures provide a clear and concise introduction to interesting topics in machine learning (ML). However, the exercises are very general and use 'black box' ML algorithms for most of the solutions. For me, the exercise structure was more confusing than educating. I am aware that this is the intro course to the specialization, and I am looking forward to actually building the algorithms in the future courses. Too bad you can only take the entire specialization over the course of ~6 months, and not at your own pace! Especially since the homework is checked automatically.",3
69082,"lectures were well done, but the strong focus on using graphlab ruined this course for me",3
69085,Fun lectures but the coverage is too simplistic. Looking forward to the more in-depth courses in the specialization.,3
69114,"Very basic, the quizzes aren't clear enough",3
69141,"the lectures are pretty great, engaging. the assignments stick with the lab exercise. the forum pretty active.",3
69158,"A lot of problems with software installations. But, the professors for this class seem to be very passionate about the course and they teach well. If not for a lot of problems faced during software installations(which is still not resolved), would have given 5 stars",3
69179,"as already explained in the preceding question, this MOOC is less well built and thus useful than the preceding one, partly due to the lack of time and efforts to present the tools, among which the score, the savoir relier protocol which stays on the whole quite theoretical, and some of the leadership models which are given too short a time for students to really make themselves an opinion about it.too many interventions from Oriane and references to what was certainly a nice show, would be good to balance testimonies from young students with more development coming from mature managersthis said, on the whole the MOOC stays a very interesting activity, and my last word will be to thank the team and wish for the SR community to become live, as I have found the conversation a very useful and surprising method.",3
69244,"This is nice, few interesting ideas and tips. I was hoping for more advanced things, to learn a bit more and for less ads during these lessons. Anyway many thanks for putting this together!",3
69284,It would be even more interesting if the chinese caracters were written with the Pinyin (and not just the pinyin).,3
69388,Ok as intro to chinese language,3
69412,"I could not finish this course, although I admire the teacher for preparing this difficult material for English speakers. I have studied several Romance and one Semitic language but I was unable to understand the lectures here. I did pass the first few quizzes but I did not feel that I knew what I was doing. I really am motivated to learn some Chinese because it is like a 2nd or at least 3rd language in my city and very much a 1st or 2nd language in my neighborhood. But I needed something a little more tangible with which to get started . I am sure this says more about my inability than the teacher's ability. I know I am not explaining myself well; I simply mean that to learn a language in which the alphabet is different and the meanings are based on emphasis rather than actual words, requires, I think, perhaps a bit more anchoring for the complete novice. For example, i wish we could have learned some simple conversational phrases, early on, just to get started, without worrying right away about all the sounds. Then once we can do that, we could get a bit more technical. Also, it would be helpful to be referred to a relevant text book. However, thank you for the effort. I hope Coursera will offer more languages since I could not find any other languages in the list.",3
69446,Sub in spanish plz,3
69484,"This course was effective in testing what was learned and in testing simple, useful expressions, words, and sentences. However, I would have liked to learn Chinese characters along with the pinyin, as in China reading the characters is just as important as speaking. Also, I believe the quizzes were a bit too simple, there should have been more multiple choice answers to chose from, more questions in general, and even some pronunciation practice.",3
69491,Pretty good course for beginners.,3
69500,"For me this kind of teaching is not very useful. I will want to learn more abou grammar so I can make sentences with sense alone. And of course more of phonetics. The teacher was great, she speaks very clear and explain well",3
69509,"I had loved this course, because they teach you a lot of in Chinese and we can improve your language cultural.",3
69521,"I would give it a five-star but at the beginning it was confusing how to access certain parts, there were no instructions on ho",3
69522,"I think, for beginners, it's a good job but the quiz is really hard to use !!",3
69536,"The teacher spoke very clearly, but the transcripts of each lecture should have included the Pinyin transcriptions. Without them,they were no help.",3
69576,"A good introduction, but it would be nice to learn a little more about written Chinese and some basic grammar. Also, like all on-line courses, this one tests how good the student is at listening, but not how good they are at speaking. You can get high marks but still be unable to utter a single word or read any Kanji characters.",3
69597,The course only contains a basic introduction to chineese. You need further sessions to learn a language completely and to have any significant benifit from the effort put in.,3
69612,Good course :)!,3
69678,It is intresting Course,3
69681,I´ve missed Chinese hanzi.But apart from that the course and tests are all good.,3
69699,"Focuses on pronunciation and basic pinyin. I think this might be a difficult course to start with, although the quizes themselves are very easy. Vocabulary is very lightly covered.",3
69707,"Well, it is a fairly good introduction to chinese. It's short and easy. However, I expected much more from the course.",3
69715,"It is quite good course for beginners those are Latin-Language-speaking people. You don't need to learn a chinese characters. So, it is very simple.But, I think that these lectures lacks logiccal explanation. Even in beginning, the logical sturucte is undoubtedly important for further learning.And, Quiz are really easy. So, you can finish this course even in a day if you have a sufficient time. I do not think that this course will make someone really spaek Chinee in China. But, this should be recommended for only those are interested in Chinese and do not have a plan to go to china.",3
69722,"An easy course, though I disliked the lack of Chinese characters (only pinyin - the transcription) and lack of grammar rules. I recommend it only for beginners who know nothing of Chinese.",3
69735,"This is a very good course to learn some basic expressions and, most of all, get a good first grasp of Chinese pronunciation. However I found the course structure quite repetitive over the seven weeks: Every other module is structured in the same way: ""Which fruit do you like? Apple, banana, orange..."", then the week after it's ""Which sport do you like? Basketball, cycling, running"". For a seven-week course this was not challenging enough. But it's a good start.",3
69749,"It's a great course! The only thing I did not fully like was the we could not learn any of the characters. I guess this course helped to develop the tones and the recognition of them, but, I think that a little shape in the characters and how each sound could improve this course a lot.",3
69775,"For the amount of money one is paying for this product, one would at least expect teacher-student interaction. The tests are too easy, one can't learn properly from them.",3
69779,"I think the quizzes could've been higher quality. Many of the images used in the quizzes were very confusing. Also, i think more character recognition instead of focus on pin yin would've been more beneficial",3
69782,"I'd like to know more day-to-day information to keep a conversation, I like how it started, but some instructions were not clear. And I'd like to see the characters to start learning how some words are written.",3
69789,"Learning some of the radicals and simple words would make this course much more valuable. It already is very useful, why not do better? :)",3
69796,Course is enjoyable and interesting so far.,3
69856,"Great overview of many models and techniques, but very high level. Would have greatly benefited from links to resources to learn more about all the subjects. This course leaves students with only basic knowledge of the subject matter, which is fine considering the course timeline. But, for those who want to explore further please recommend sources of additional reading and research.",3
69859,I felt that topics were not treated in enough depth. It was a lot of topics to cover in a 4-week course.I learned a lot from the kaggle competition.,3
69860,it gets on my nerve from 3rd Work onwards,3

69878,Interesting course and specialization. A few inaccuracies need to be corrected so it can be properly pursued at its best.,3
69880,"The lectures in this course were very good but I would have preferred much, much more homework to practice the concepts covered in the lectures.Also, I was somewhat disappointed when a certain issue with the course that I asked about in the forums was never addressed by the course staff. Of course, I could have been wrong about it but, but based on the response from other students I was not the only one having this problem.",3
69883,It's a decent course. Not as thorough as Analytics Edge or Machine Learning (by Andrew Ng).,3
69957,Who can read Korean should really learn this course?,3
69959,Unbelievably difficult for understanding!,3
70075,It was alright ..confusing at times an seemed a bit convoluted. someone needs to come up with a better way to explain these concepts so that they are not so jumbled.,3
70139,"Doug's lectures were great! He's entertaining and he gets the concepts across very clearly. I struggled with the course itself, however. The participation rate was low and the iOS app was so buggy I deleted it. The web interface was better but still difficult to work with.The iOS app would forget I was in the course and lose my assignments. It also wouldn't let me open the discussion forums. With the technical problems and low participation I can only give the course 3/5.",3
70160,"The annotations of the different poems were great and taught me a lot about different poetic elements, but the lectures were unbearably corny with all of the different sound effects and bits. I found myself reading the transcripts because I could not watch the videos without feeling like I was being talked down to or that the instructor didn't take the course seriously.",3
70194,"The course material is very good. The most obvious issue with the course, is that peer revision takes a very long time, which means that you will get overdue assignments no matter what. For instance, after three weeks I'm still waiting for a revision that I wanted to use for the final workshop. I assume that instructor involvement in project revision is impossible in this kind of online course; but perhaps, if the issue is that people aren't getting their work reviewed, there could be an incentive for reviewers, for example, get an instructor/mentor review, if you submit at least, say, 10 thorough peer reviews.",3
70234,"It gets 3 stars only because I learned new things in the class. But the teacher (Bless his heart for meaning well) ended up being rather annoying and distracting with his constant antics. It's okay to throw that in every now and then but this was really awful, makes you want to forward to the parts where he is normal. That's when you can pay attention to him and understand it all. Think you should ask him to tone it down big time... Everything in small doses is great.I think there is an unfair marking system in the last week - I wrote about it too. I don't want to pay for a course and have my points cut for silly reasons. If that's how it works, I never want to pay for certificates. What's the point in paying for 'subjectivity' or 'having to adapt my answers to suit the course'.",3
70241,Elementary and entertaining with some unique and creative prompts.,3
70249,Not as much creative flexibility as I thought there would be. Writing to prompts left very little room to create poetry that felt like my own. Good short course (knocked it out in a couple of days) for revising/learning techniques.,3
70283,I thought there will be deeper info.,3
70286,The course is too much focused on the U.S.,3

70319,"I expected much more in this course. In my point of view, a very long time was spent to learn how to draw something in the screen.

70470,coordination is required between the lectures and the assignments so a to fill any gaps,3
70515,"Considering the contents of the second and third course, this was too basic.",3
70618,The course is very good explained. However the practice relies a lot in code that cannot be explained like applets or mapping components... Sometimes you need more time to go through the documentation of a graphic library that you will never use again than in doing the actual assignment's core thing.,3
70620,Peer reviews was unfair. It's must be any methods to exclude inadequate learners from reviewing. Blacklists is only one way to stop them now.,3
70650,If you are a beginner in OO not recommend .,3
70700,Not a difficult course but teaches you much about Java.,3
70753,Decent Introductory course for someone who is a newbie.,3
70793,Very confusing course for those who have no previous experience in Java.,3
70822,Not nearly as good as Part 1.,3
70870,Slow start to week 1 but 'The Modern and the Postmodern (Part 2) is a continuation to 'The Modern and the Postmodern (Part 1) so best to understand (part 1). Looking forward to week 2.,3
70884,"The instructer is not fluid, a ""mentor"" is devoid of critical thinking in communicating through the discussions section, the peers are reviewing haphazardly while ""mentors"" offer their own essays (from the past?) where they use material outside of the course readings which may sound plagiarizing after that long warning in each introductory section for writing assignements.",3
70908,The course was tough and was explained in a very fast way assuming that the student knows prior statistics.,3
70915,Be warned - practice problems come from a textbook not available online or open-source. Forums do not offer much help or interaction. Material is presented clearly and lectures are well-delivered.,3
71031,"In my opinion the positive thing of this course is bringing a very important area to Coursera. But there are some things that I believe could and should be improved. First, Duke has presented courses that have a lot of content, and it is a bit disapointing to only see two modules on this course. At least four modules should be presented. Also the weekly content should be more extended. In most parts of the course there are a lot of technical concepts, and the course lacks any type of resources. It should had been included the lecture slides and also external sources for further student development. Just having the videos to learn doesn't provide - again in my opinion, a very engaging learning experience. A small detail - in part of the course page the course is entitled Oil & Gas Industries, while in another place is entitled Oil & Gas Industry. A small detail but it should be corrected. This is my opinion.",3
71036,"Assessments are way harder than the taught content, be aware to spend way more time on them than the estimates.",3
71055,"The course is not really about Functional Programming, but more about Scala in general. I've learnt much more about FP by reading Learn You a Haskell for Great Good by Miran Lipovača, and Functional Programming in Scala by Paul Chiusano and Rúnar Bjarnason",3
71073,Howeworks are way to difficult even for someone who has programming knowledge like me and the lectures doesn't do enough justice to prepare students for the homework.,3
71091,"If looking only at what is being taught in this course, it's quite good. And I can heartily recommend it.The lecture videos are extremely monotonic! Which makes it _very_ hard to keep focus and pay attention. It feels like hypnosis sometimes. Several colleagues have the same experience with this course. Which is why I'm only giving it 3 stars.",3
71137,"The grading seems to round up to 100%, which makes the assignments that are already generally easy far too easy. I took this course instead of just doing my own thing so that I could get some structure and motivation. While there was some structure, it was quite basic, and the motivation was diminished by ""good enough"" not being much. I was considering taking the later courses in the specialization, but I'm afraid that without real grading I won't learn as much as if I learn more slowly outside of Coursera.",3
71163,"The assignments took me so long. It was supposed to be 3 hours but, got obsessed to have them ended ok, but in 15 hours nearly. I would recommend to build up from very basic stuff, and as the learning advances, going into more difficulty.The hints for the assignments were valid in the the last lesson, but for another lesson, I think lesson 4, there was no hint.Thanks",3
71208,"This was a decent overview of FP principals, but a poor introduction to the Scala language. In fact, the requirements should just come out and state that you must have prior Scala knowledge to most thoroughly appreciate the course. The last 2 assignments may have been ok for 3 hours (doubtful) for someone with Scala experience, but they really should be marked more appropriately for time for those of us new to Scala. I'd say 6 hours; easily more than that for the last assignment.Also, no slides or related handouts are provided. If you remember seeing something on one of the slides shown, you'll have to look back, scanning through all the videos trying to find it. This is a very poor way to manage course content - forcing students to rely solely on the videos.I'm left feeling I've only learned a smattering here and there of Scala, and don't think I'll take the remainder of the specialization as I had intended.",3
71251,"The first couple of weeks were awesome - love Scala the language and the whole functional approach, and the detailed description of how the language actually fits together.Also love how the homework teaches you how to setup IDE, create unit tests, and submit actual code as homework - not just workbooks and multiple-choice quizzes like in some other courses.But why oh why was it necessary to go in specific detail over how to define natural numbers from first principles using classes, or spend a whole week on lists, etc? All that might be fine for general education in a university context, but as someone who does want to understand Scala, but from a perspective of getting cool things done - that bit was a total waste of time.Would be a better and shorter course if those 'didactic' bits were trimmed.",3
71257,1) quite academic assignments which are hard from the 1st one and are very far from regular programmer's job2) very quiet voice/record made it really-really hard to listen the course in subway/metro,3
71282,It was Ok. I would have liked to learn a bit more about monads / monoids etc and I found the final week a bit disconnected.,3
71332,"Good material, but the lecture format was very dry and composed primarily of long videos.",3
71375,"This course was splitted in order to get more money, and we know it",3
71473,"The only attractive thing in this course is a name of the author. The course itself is poorly designed, homework is hardly connected to the content of lectures. Might be interesting as an introduction for Scala newcomers, though.",3
71479,Good to absorb Scala as new language. But No farther guidance to how to think in Scala way. Please give some more(additional) exerciser which are real application using framework like Play.,3
71490,"This is a reasonably thorough introduction to the principals of functional programming in scala, but to fully grasp the material presented I found it necessary to include supplemental material such as the functional programming in scala book by Paul Chiusano (forward by the course instructor funnily enough). One point of frustration however was the near total unavailability of the course TA's or instructor. Also because the only forum for interacting with them is entirely public it's impossible to receive any formal code review apart from the automated tests they run when you submit. There were multiple occasions where I wanted feedback on not just the technical correctness of my solution but also to know if there might have been a more idiomatic or generally efficient (read: tail-recursive) way to express some peculiar bit of logic.",3
71616,"I dont know how the peer reviews are done and like everyone else says its hard to trust them. However, it was a nice course I certainly learnt something that would really help my job.",3
71645,Some of the videos made too long by unnecessary clips from hollywood which illustrate the point but are too long. The assignment of the final week felt tacked on and not at all related to what was taught that week.,3
71660,"Good course. However, it was very basic. I learned, but not sufficient for the 4 hours per week that I invested.",3
71691,3 stars for the missing pdf slides. other than that it was very well structured and oraganized!!,3
71698,The peer grading system need improvement. More specific grading rules needed. Coursera must supervise the grading process. The participants who put grades not according to the rules must be penalized.,3
71716,"Material generally interesting but felt a bit low bang for the buck, with much of it a bit obvious.",3
71728,"I have learnt a lot or new information and improved my understanding in the filed of motivation. I have leart that as a leader you need to communicate clearly the vision, set goals which are in line with the vision. The thing that I miss is how to connect the motivation with the set goals.",3
71758,"It gives some good birds eye view of the topic, but I would like to see more in-depth and technical material.",3
71772,"This course is good only to give an overview of supply chain logistics, but it does not give little deep to in depth knowledge.",3
71785,"It gives some good birds eye view of the topic, but I wish the course had more in-depth discussion of topics and more technical material.",3
71796,It includes several information about logistics field but it is not so sophisticated,3
71800,This course lacks much explanation even on the basic logistics concepts and halfheartedly explains whats left.,3
71829,"This course is mis-titled. There is very little music involved and a lot of social action. The discussions and videos are interesting, buy I am confused about the use of ""music"" to carry the course's agenda. Perhaps ""The Influence of the Arts on Social Action"" would better define the intent of the course.",3
71839,"I think that this course has wonderful material, however, I think that more than 2 people should be required to peer review the assignments so it is a balanced grade. In my other classes, at least 5 reviewers are required to review each individual assignment.",3
71855,it is good lecture to learn SCM in other concepts,3
71858,It is a very good course where students get to learn about supply chain management. People who are looking for deeper knowledge about SCM can opt this course. My only suggestion to this course is that they need to improve the quality of the video(not the content) and increase the difficulty level of the exams.,3
71870,"Lecturer is downright boring and not engaging.Could had used more real-world companies as examples for teaching, including pictures, but it's the same bland slides again and again.",3
71896,"I definitely learned a few new things with this course but was hoping to learn some cutting edge tips on how to differentiate yourself as an artist with modern technology and how to build your fan-base online. It would be great to have tips on what to do on a day-to-day basis as an artist in the digital age. I also wish that the course covered more on how to avoid being ""shelved"" by a label or management company.",3
71941,"Good, but I expected more...",3
72026,"Interesting concepts. The instructor is knowledgeable. As an organizational development practitioners, I found it very academic relative to the terms used and examples given. In some cases, I had to translate the terms used to every day layman language to really understand the concepts as they would apply in my day-to-day work.",3
72079,Did not learn that much through that course.,3
72159,"This is a good course to get you thinking about your future classroom. However, do not expect it to necessarily challenge you to think in depth about your practice or provide engaging discussion via the forums.Nevertheless, a good way to get you thinking critically about how you want to run your classroom and provide examples and suggestions.",3
72166,There are some ideas expressed in video that I found helpful. The assignments were very helpful as I was able to prepare for the 1st day of teaching.,3
72191,"The content of the course is very nice. Especially the part about the instruments is very good. It's good to see exact instruments of them. Hovewer, I think, a course about music should include a little bit music :) It will be better to figure out the problem about copyright. I prepared a Spotify list that includes the songs mentioned during the course but It's better to listen the music or see the lyrics during the course.Thank you very much :)",3
72193,"The professor is very knowledgable. However, the course has too much memorized stuff to remember (especially when students try to finish the tests). One more thing, though at the beginning of the class, the professor notified that Beatles songs won't be played in the class due to copyright reason, but when students really go through the whole class, it is very hard to follow. Isn't music all about feeling? But the class is more like a history class. : (",3
72203,"Clearly, the instructor is passionate about the Beatles (as am I). However it's really hard to talk about the music of the Beatles and not nine able to even quote from their songs, much less play their music! No songs, no music for fear of being sued!Takes a good deal away from the course!",3
72219,"You can't have a ""Music of the Beatles"" course without playing some of the music. Surely under the Fair Use provisions of the Copyright Act parts of the Beatles music could be played as well as parts of YouTube",3
72221,"Apparently, the instructor is well-informed in the history of the band.Nevertheless, information is delivered in a huge portions, sometimes cluttered and it s easy to lost in the narrative.Sound quality is bad (the volume is jumping sometimes and there is a lot of noise)May I suggest that you provide a short arts of songs you are talking about?I understand, there are copyright issues, but still, something should be done about it.All in all, I wish to enroll in the second, improved release of this course",3
72230,"I'm grateful to the professor for constructing and delivering this course. I learned a few things but the lack of musical analysis was a disappointment. I know that form is important but there was no mention of modulation, chord progressions or cadence styles (John versus Paul). I feel the course should have been titled The History of the Beatles.",3
72260,"The best part of this course was, of course, the videos. But it just scratched the surface. I would have been happy to have a whole unit on Eudora Welty or B B King or the Chitlen Circuit. Each and every one of the films was priceless. But the course didn't fully exploit the possibilities of the web and I felt it was very static.",3
72275,"Too reliant on materials directly collected by professor, too little context of larger artistic community.",3
72277,"This was a really good course. I was mostly interested in the music and related culture, but I will be interested to read some of the books that were discussed. Thanks!",3
72278,"Interesting introduction to the South, Professor Ferris tries to be as exhaustive as the format allows however the exhaustivity leads to a sense of barely skimming the surface over too many topics. I would have preferred a little less and a few more in depth analysis.Impressive archives collection, definitely a plus of this course.",3
72285,Examples are good. Lecturer could be more interesting,3
72292,This course would work better if the material wasn,3
72326,"Good things:• Simple, clear concepts that serve as a foundation for further study of finance.• Many examples, repeated often to help gather basic ideas.• A pace that is easy to follow.• Friendly lecturer, even entertaining at times; which makes lessons fun to watch.• Helpful and kind teaching assistants.Not so good things:• Lessons alone don't teach you what you need; they don't even hint at some formulas that are necessary to pass the test.• Because of that, expect to find surprising problems and ideas on tests. You'll need to spend a long time working on them, probably attempt multiple times, and definitely visit the fora to consult with others.• Lack of assignments or already-solved exercises, similar to the ones used on the tests. There are only tests. Self-assessing assignments would be helpful to ""try"" the tests before actually attempting them.• The course is actually 5 weeks long (not 6 as stated, since there's an ""empty"" week). I doubt that's useful as the staff claim (I simply skipped one week and continued normally).• The professor insists repeatedly on a grandiose, philosophical, cheesy view of finance (how it'll make your life so much better, how it's applicable to so many aspects, how money isn't everything) but, in my opinion, betrays that spirit from day one by sticking to the most obvious applications and examples. He could, for example, show how these methods would apply to food supplies, barter, social prestige, trustworthiness, confidence in people or institutions, certainty about logic assertions, or other things that aren't measurable in dollars. He could use real-life examples (disastrous financial decisions in History, GDP of countries, international trade, loans taken by cities or countries, etc), and that would make it so much more engaging (I only remember one question about the price paid for the Manhattan island). He doesn't even use other currencies in examples nor tests.",3
72336,Clear but the content is a bit too simple. Need to include more real world scenario and application.,3
72371,"While Professor Kaul's enthusiasm and passion for finance is inspiring, his lectures are not entirely helpful come time to face assignments. He often rambles through the material, spending more time talking about his life rather than the material at hand. When he decides to finally talk about the material, it presented in a disorganized and confusing fashion. If he developed a disciplined schedule with material that was on par with the assignments, this course would not have been nearly as frustrating; challenging assignments, I agree, are crucial for learning the material well. I just wish I didn't have to spend more time browsing the internet finding material pertinent to answering his arbitrarily open-ended questions.",3
72415,the equations/math could have been delivered in a much better way,3
72478,"The material is excelente, But I would like you to promote a little more the community. Due to, sometime is difficult to advance when you don't understand a subject.",3
72479,very interesting environment to learn the subject.,3
72487,The course lacks deep theoretical understanding of the concepts.,3
72497,Nice explanation and nice tasks but the course is designed for graphlab. If you want to use something else the tasks are often badly described or it is impossible to pass the,3
72539,Good course content but it can be very difficult to get help if you are stuck on something.,3
72576,"This course offers great background instruction on Machine Learning and I would give it 5 stars except for the following:First, there doesn't seem to be any moderation of the session discussions except for help from other students. This was worth a -2 star penalty. This and the lack of any review of linear algebra and vectorized solutions, I think, is giving some students the impression that they should be coding loops in their functions to build and solve ML models.Next, I am auditing the course, and this is the first course where I was not able to submit quizzes. Therefore, I can only guess at my solutions. This was worth a -1 star penalty.UPDATE: not being able to submit quizzes is a ""feature"" of the new Coursera platform. I never did get an answer from the discussion forums, but I see the same problem in other Coursera courses I am taking.However, I still think the course is worth taking, so I added back a star. This is the second ML course I have taken. The first was from Stanford ML course which was very specific to implementation in the Octave language. I got a lot more background information from this course, and I think it is well taught. Just wish there were more moderators that were actively watching the discussion list.",3
72581,Rather elementary and slow-moving for my taste. But the material is competently presented and covers the material it is advertised to cover.,3
72583,"Passing mark is 100%, it is tough for me and demotivating to persuade further. And the course becomes too extra factors and complexity on later classes, it made me to lose the interest on the algorithm and course.I cannot complete it because of these two factors",3
72762,Course materials are well organized. It could be improved by adding more description.,3
72795,"Missing in-lesson quiz, with all the homeworks being at the end of the week: this make following the pace quite tough",3
72929,"Basic overview of Typographical ideas, terms and so forth. A bit short and not very technical, but playing with Type as an integral part of design was really fun and inspirational.",3
73005,Good but nowhere near as in-depth as some of the other courses found on coursera.,3
73057,"Very interesting topic, but even for an introductory course not nearly enough to justify a full 4 week course for € 71!The first course, Fundamentals of Graphic Design, had more content, more (optional) assignments, and covered Typography, too.",3
73074,"Would have welcomed more or longer lectures, and more variety in the assignments.",3
73085,It was extremely high level. I would have appreciated more content in the videos.,3
73099,"Good material, but not nearly enough to justify a full course. Should've been 2X as many lectures and assignments at least.",3
73134,Very technical and focuses more on cosmology than on the principles of Philosophy of Science,3
73137,Really informative. Equations were a bit difficult to understand. I felt that there was a bias towards anthropic principle.,3
73140,"Found it a bit hard to follow, some aspects could've been explained in more detail.",3
73142,"Though familiar with the material, the lectures made several very nice key points about the Philosophy of Science which I found useful. However there are a few issues :-a lot of the lecturing is on a board which is hard to read-there is a lot more science than there is PhilosophyThe latter isn't necessarily a bad thing, but based on the title I expected more of the latter.",3
73145,"This course has great content and I believe the professor is very knowledgeable about this subject matter. However, at times, it can be very difficult to understand what he is saying. I believe he knows the English language very well but, between his deep accent and speaking very quickly, there are a number of times I cannot understand what he is saying. This is reflected at times when reading the transcript below each video. I found it better to slow the video down to 0.75X the regular speed to hear him but that did not remove all of the difficulty.",3
73150,"The instructor speaks too quickly and I think this will make it difficult for non-native English speakers to understand the material. This material will also be more understandable to individuals with a statistical analysis background, not enough time is spent on explanation and it will be necessary to supplement the class if you don't have the proper background. Passing the class by rote following of the examples will not give you the proper proficiency.",3
73155,There was some amount of confusion in the Quizzes and we didnt get moderation. Some more discussion in forums should be encouraged.,3
73160,"very repetitive with previous courses (especially week on competitive advantage), otherwise many concepts uses in a different way with different terms.",3
73201,Interesting course. Would have been more helpful if had actually taught how to break a problem in parts and then create a policy.,3
73205,"There were some great lectures included in this course, but the emphasis on the content we were not receiving was a bit disheartening. I would have loved to view more of the controversial lectures that were referenced in the wrap-up.",3
73206,"While U.S. politics is important for many other disciplines, this course didn't have that much depth in my opinion to really be applicable on demands of international student and point of view. Still, very interesting lectures and good talks.",3
73234,"Interesting lecture series. The lectures are largely America centered with courses on presidential war powers, the functioning of governors. In this lectures the main focus is rather politics than policy. Although very interesting, the lecture series does not really live up to its title.",3
73266,This course was interesting and informative. Would have been better if the online portions of the MOOC reflected a wide range of speakers.,3
73316,Very much a straight lecture course of rather difficult material.,3
73322,It's really informative and helpful.I will definitely recommend it.,3
73343,"This course seems to require a high level of foundation knowledge that I don't have. I had to leave the course before completion because of that. In fact, most of the videos were too complex to understand without prior knowledge on the matter and the deadlines are quite tight to have time to research all the topics.I believe the course content is quite interesting; but too complicated. I would appreciate less text and abstract drawings on the slide, maybe an intro with images (maybe 3D) of the human body to give a little bit of background on what's going to be discussed in the class...",3
73380,The course should give more details.,3
73444,"The content is quite clear the course is going good so far ; however, i recommend the lecturer be more lively to help other be more interested in the course",3
73445,Very informative - but I don't like the dry delivery style.,3
73450,"Learnt a lot of stuff on how things happen inside all of us.Struggled in few sections, as i have not been in tough with physiology ...Feel program could be much more valuable by using1) 3D videos to support the lecture2) more examples of the application of the concepts in real life3) increase the extent of interdisciplinary elements (Sports, medical, day in the life...)4) Videos of Experts to share their findings/research",3
73454,The course seems to require a high level of foundation knowledge that I don't necessarily have,3
73459,I watch the videos after work when I get home and Jennifer Carbrey puts me to sleep. The presentation is such that it is very difficult to stay focused.,3
73467,There's a lot of material and it's hard to grasp it all. Hopefully that will improve as the course continues.,3
73532,"To US centered. Would have expected international approach as Coursera should appeal to World. Also too theoretical, more graphs and formulas would help to understand. For example deman and supply functions. When there is cost function determining or demand in certain industry dependent on market structure. When Price or MR determines equilibrium between S and D etc. Too simplistic.",3
73566,Topics about Supply & Demand were interesting.Rest was too much theoretical for me. I would have liked shorter presentations with more concrete examples.Design of the presentations could be improved as well.,3
73574,"Fairly in-depth, but the lecture slides and examples have an antiquated feel and the testing involves very little other than simple recall (typically with examples already shown in the lecture slides). Evaluations should require more problem-solving and applying learned materials to new examples.",3
73589,"Al Filreis is an excellent instructor and very charismatic, unfortunately the poetry taught consists of only one worldview: secular humanist. Its too bad, otherwise I would offer 5 stars.",3
73636,Very useful!,3
73661,Hi My name is Kapil Raj and i am from India. This is the first course i have done from Coursera. Its an awesome course. Its a great course for someone who have just wanted to learn programming or have a little prior knowledge in programming.,3
73832,"In general, it's very good!1) The interview and other stuff in the bonus video should renamed as optional or other names. It's misleading people to think bonus as materials related for the class.2) As the name is programming for everybody, will be better if some of the explanations or slides can be linked with daily life cases for people to understand the concept easily.",3
73855,The approach of teaching has to be changed more examples with clear explanation has to be given.,3
73883,A good course for the beginners. The language and explanations are very very simple.,3
73899,Easy MOOC for starters,3
73917,I rate this course as a three out of five because I feel that during the 'worked exercise videos' it would be much more helpful if only the correct code was shown. It's very confusing to see the wrong code typed in and then the correct code. I think it would help students to more easily remember the function of code if only the right code is shown in examples.,3
73926,This was a very basic course. I was expecting something more advanced. But all of what was taught was good and clear.,3
73939,"The course is not bad, but it teach Python 2! It Should teach Python 3.",3
73994,There should be more challenging and more programing exercises.,3
74020,"I believe programming need practice. I would prefer to have many many assignments, like 20 on each week, at least. That's the best way to remember and get speed on simple things.",3
74058,"I really like the main information I got with this course, but I think that it was too basic. I never learned any programming language before this course, but sometimes I felt that the teacher was going too slow on explaining somethings.",3
74068,A bit easy. Completed in a week,3
74107,There arent enough examples to get us a good path to learning Python. More practice and solved questions were required.,3
74109,to basic,3
74207,"This course is a very basic introduction to Python. I have coded in other languages and found myself skipping the lectures and just reading the book and working the exercises. If I needed additional information I would use a certain YouTube resource (thanks Bucky) because his lectures are so much more useful. Also, I'm not really sure why I can't start the next course and have to wait until the start date more than a week from now. I can't seem to think of a good reason for this.",3
74269,"It was a little short and the quizzes and short assignments are too easy, so they do not really cement your knowledge of the programming concepts. I believe beginners should enroll in another Python course or self-study more on the side to fully grasp the concepts. Nevertheless, it was a good introduction to Python.",3
74285,"This is strictly for beginners. If you have had little hands on experience in Python, you may not find it that useful, though it's good to rehearse a bit. Also this course was on Python 2, so try to identify the differences between 2 and 3. One concern is that Python installation steps are covered in every week's classes which is redundant one.",3
74308,Very nice course but a shame you cannot do any of the quizzes without an upgrade to the payed track.,3
74352,"Although the course pace was very well suited for a total beginner, I found the didactics of this course not so well-structured. The examples and starter codes caused quite some confusion, and the underlying coding principles were not made very explicit. I've finished an introductory Python course from the University of Toronto, and found that course much better structured. It gave me a level of understanding that I would probably not have reached by following the UMich course alone.",3
74361,Quite easy for me,3
74409,This is a good course for pure beginner who never program before.,3
74456,It's really interesting course i like it very much thanks for all your cooperation and your education methods and thanks to coursera,3
74477,"Good intro course for a total novice. If you have some programming background, you will move through this very quickly.",3
74543,Not enough material though for a full course. This whole course can be done in few hours by people with some experience in programming. Unfortunately this does not provide enough possibilities/assignments to deeply relate to the language and really feel comfortable in it (not even at the beginners level as is the aim of the course). Nice slow introduction though.,3
74559,"too basic for me, excellent for programming newbies",3
74570,Basic intro to Python. But I found the content not to systematically organized....,3

74855,Sometimes the material was not explained sufficient enough to adequately complete the assignments. I had to use YouTube a couple times to get a better understanding of the material.,3
74866,too redundant,3
74879,The exercises are confusing.,3
74976,Course has mindblowing but it needs update,3
74985,"I wanted to get some basics of Python, but was rather disappointed by this course. It is incredibly slow, I really don't understand who might need a whole lecture to get the concept of functions or so. Probably, this course could work for children with low level of math and zero programming experience, but otherwise it is waste of your time. I added the third star just for the book which is good on its own.",3
75075,Takes a long time to figure out the problem sets,3
75209,Great course Great Instructor!I really enjoyed the course.,3
75247,"The course was very good overall but I would have often preferred for the lectures to be more on point. Some of the lectures contain lengthy introduction and gags, which I am sure many students like. Personally, though, I would have liked it better if the lectures were more focused on the material.",3
75257,Actually I know a bit python and it seems that the course was not that meangingful to me but the teacher and assignment are really nice!!!,3
75367,Parts of videos were distracting and dragged on for longer than necessary.,3
75369,"Very long but easy videos, lots of repeating material. I would not recmmend this course for someone who - like me - needs fast intro to python. However, programming assignments are good and so are the Quizes.",3
75413,Very basic,3
75425,This course is a better option to start with programming and that also with Python.,3
75630,This course is comparatively easy,3
75643,Very slow paced. I appreciate that it is bringing me up to speed for the next courses but I found the learning pace to be a bit slow with very simple test assignments.The practical code implementation assignments were great. I found they were an effective way to learn,3
75668,Could benefit from harder assignments or more,3
75678,Good vibe but way too easy.... even for beginners! I am no beginner but I finished the whole thing in less than an hour.... Not much learned,3
75774,"Explanations is pretty well, but it is not so difficulty. So it's good for beginners.",3
75832,good course. Can be better in terms of information and assignments.,3
75910,"Very easy material, with a bit boring assignments. With not much more effort more material could be covered.",3
76022,Good introduction for people who have no prior programming background,3
76039,This course is too basic....perhaps squeeze more material since it assumes you don't,3
76161,"good content, but slow pace. tiny increments per week",3
76248,Course and assignments were very easy. Could have been more challenging if assignments were little difficult.,3
76260,This course is way too simple and too slow. Probably good for someone who has never done programming before.,3
76497,Very basic stuff!!,3
76514,"Good for real beginner of programming, if you already have experience with any other language, this might be too easy",3
76529,Too easy.,3
76537,"I didn't like how there was no interaction with the other classmates or there was no easy way to comment, but I loved the way it was so interactive",3
76551,The resources weren't organized enough to be fully accessed with ease.,3
76563,The course is not that much helpful for those who want to do work for coding. I mean the level of toughness of questions is not too good to compete any coding competition.,3
76611,Maybe too easy.,3
76697,Good intro to programming. Enjoyed the coursework; plan to continue so I can learn even more...,3
76727,"Mediocre, not that helpful. Not the best. I was urged to skip all the vids in wk 2",3
76738,"Very basic introduction. If you have any coding experience in other languages, this will be extremely simple.",3
76761,"I struggled with some of the instruction as I couldn't get the exercises/quizes to work right; even with multiple views of the videos, posting questions, etc.",3
76813,"I like the sense of Humor of Dr. Charles. His teaches like someone of our age, like a friend, I appreciate that. The course will not be a burden on anyone. It's easy to follow along.The concepts taught are not taught in a structured way (although the way they are taught is good). My advice to the staff is that Structure all the similar things and explain them at one place. Some important and helpful things are left out.Overall, it's a good course for beginners.",3
76878,It is very simple course. It is perfect for nonprogrammers.,3
76882,"If you can't program at all this is an excellent course, If you know how to program in any language this course is not for you.",3
76900,good introduction for people who have never do anything with programming. It is really basic knowledge.,3
76915,excellent material.....very good teaching..,3
76941,"I'm sure this is a fantastic introduction for those with no prior programming experience, but as someone with even just a little bit of prior scripting experience, I found it extremely slow-paced. Rather than suffer through the lectures, I did DataCamp's Intro. to Python and then did all the quizzes & assignments for this class as extra practice.",3
76943,The course is pretty basic however I think it’s necessary to start with good base for the rest of the specialization courses.,3
77075,Fair course. Explanations are good and materials are solid.,3
77213,"Very well conducted for a beginner, but some lectures seems too long to convey a simple concept.",3
77269,"It is wonderful for a beginner who knows nothing about programming. If you know programming of any other languages, you can spend a few hours and quickly finish this course.",3
77275,It's easy to start python with this.,3
77280,"All of the review I've read were that the course was great, so maybe it is me that was the problem. However, as I would go through the written material, I would try to work the problems given as examples, and when they did not work, I was confused and wondered why the example given to teach us would not work. I asked for help a number of times, providing screen shots of the results I got trying to duplicate what the example was supposed to show, and page numbers of where the example was presented in the course materials. One former student basically said that I should not be trying to duplicate the examples, but just accept the concept they were trying to show. Another did a good job of explaining one of my questions, but then all replies to my question ceased. I decide to drop out of the class and try teaching myself, as I have done on everything I have learned about computers since my 1st computer in 1983. I have been very impressed with other courses given by Coursera members, but this one was not one of them. All of the other submissions praise the course, so maybe it is just me, but none of the other submissions mentioned any actual things the course had done - just that it was great.",3
77348,I think it could have less videos teaching how to install Python and more about the language principles.,3
77353,"The course assignments weren't challenging enough for me and lectures were too slow for my liking. But, I do understand that the course is more suited for people without prior experience in programming, so I have nothing to complain about. Good beginner course!",3
77382,Too easy for me,3
77398,Videos tended to be a bit longer than necessary. Might consider c,3
77425,"A good course to understand the basics of Python, though there's no difference between the book chapters and the video lectures (lectures are basically readings of the chapters) - I expected more info in general.",3
77477,"Very thorough. Walks you step by step, but a little too slow and detailed for someone with minimal coding background.",3
77540,"There is some good material but the presentation seems a bit uneven; some parts are repeated many times at very slow speed while other parts, equally important, barely rate a word. The quizzes can be very searching and you really need to have paid close attention to every word (however quickly or slowly it passed by).I would have liked more practical exercises. The accompanying book is good and I am still looking forward to the other courses in the sequence which move further away from my limited knowledge of Python.",3
77655,"I liked it but I think it's a little too basic, even for me. Thanks you very much for this.",3
77676,Appreciate the efforts done by the team to design the Course in such a way that even a Beginner can learn. Thank you for that!,3
77680,Exercise need to be more heavy,3
77732,"The content inside this course is well tought through. Questions and asignments holds high quality.If you haven't been in contact with Python before, this might be the first step for you, and when I say first step, then I really mean first step.",3
77761,The difficulty of assignments should be increased.,3
77828,Both the lectures and text have good information and well explained examples. Low production value.,3
77829,Too easy,3
77869,This course is way tooooooo easy for me. I'm a PhD candidate in statistics. I think it will be nice if I can have a diagnostic survey to test whether this course is suitable for me or not before the course.,3
77880,I feel it's too simple and really just for beginners who know nothing about coding,3
77916,The content is good and easy to follow but lack depth.,3
77956,Too easy,3
77976,The videos were very slow and many contained useless information.,3
78001,it's too basic for my taste.,3
78018,"The course is too simplistic in my opinion. The entire 7 week course should be condensed into the first week - a single one hour lesson.Still, I appreciate the time and effort of the course staff and thank them for providing the course.",3
78127,Good course for beginers,3
78132,"Easy to get in, now I know the basics of Python.. however, maybe too much extra stuff and discussion about this and that.",3
78143,"very fundamental, but the instructor is tiresomely talkative...for example, when he talked about examples, he compared each two numbers again and again, what I want to is the logic to find the max/min number, not 49 is larger than 9!!!everyone knows it !! he compared every number every time ....it is boring!!! I will not choose this course if there are other python courses open at this time!!",3
78217,Kinda too slow in speed. But overall great,3
78272,"This is a course that would be helpful to complete programming novices. Any prior knowledge of programming is likely to render it useless to the student. That being said, a programming newbie should have no problem following it.The professor speaks slower than necessary. 1.75x or 2x speeds make the pace more manageable and is still easy to follow.In addition, it uses an old version of Python, which tends to make the exercises slightly annoying.",3
78322,too easy and pretty long for me,3
78326,"Too easy, for novices in programming",3
78477,a bit slow but good for someone with zero experience,3
78492,very basic,3
78515,"It was a bit too easy. But a good foundation for the ""Everybody"" audience.",3
78574,breaking down the videos into various little ones would be more productive i think.,3
78608,i am very excited that i become a programmer and ihope that in the end of this course i become like a professional programer.,3
78630,So easy,3
78704,Clear instructions. Good for beginners!,3
78713,"This course is indicated to anyone looking for an overview of Python programming. All Assignments and Quizzes are quite simple problems. To be honest, I expected more of this course.",3
78719,The course is too very basic and is very slow. I am not from a programming background and still feel so.,3
78725,"I was expecting a more in depth, more rigorous course. More homework, at the very least. Also, the first two weeks could have been condensed down to one.",3
78728,"It is a very simple and smooth course for new comers, i think it would be better to have more challenging tasks and more related to a real world, that's why i've put 3 stars. Practise is everything, so good tasks are the essential part of learning process.",3
78761,"Although the course seems to be very interesting and cover wide spectrum of NLP subjects, it is full with references to other materials some of them are no longer exist in the location given. Also the programming exercises quite often are detached from the material and also have references to materials that were not covered in lectures accompany them.My advice to author - made lectures and exercises more self-contained. Do not try to cover enormous amount of material during one week. Make exercised to be closely connected to the material given during that week.",3
78768,"A lot of good information, but I found it hard to retain most of it without a less dry style of presentation. Assignment were quite hard, and instructions were a bit too sketchy.",3
78769,"It's more towards teaching linguistics and theoretical concepts. I understand that is also required to understand the subject. However, I was expecting more practical training on coding different programs with various ways. I suggest to introduce a balance in theory concepts and practical training.",3
78811,"It's ok; worth your time if you are trying to get into philosophy and want part of the proper foundation. Overall I enjoyed it and it was good as a hand-hold through the pre-Socratics and some of the most essential Platonic writings.Pros: the videos are pretty easy to understand, and the material chosen/covered is good to know.Cons: the video quiz questions are really...dull...and there are too many. A downside of the ease of the videos/lectures is that they don't really go that in depth, and they're nowhere near the quality I've seen in other Coursera courses (like the Kierkegaard course from UCopenhagen).",3
78812,Heavy going! Informative though - and an engaging teacher.,3
78836,"The course material is OK; the lectures are fun and interesting, but to pass the course you need to submit an assignment that is subjected to peer review and you will need to get approval by all of your peers. However the act of subscribing to a MOOC alone does not make people suited to review other peoples work...",3
78843,The professor is animated and clearly loves her subject. I don't think we need to stop so frequently to ask a quiz question though. It's best to keep going on one subject without interruption.,3
78947,"Slow down. Introduce more R before asking to create projects in R. Only because I know other programming language was I able to finish week 5. Also very strong group of mentors... God bless you mentors!Disconnect between course objectives and programming assignments / labs. Reading book you learn one thing, watching lectures another and then unrelated labs, which then culminate in something totally different during week 5?",3
78957,"It can be made more informative on theory side. The course is bit fast i guess or may be all the courses are like this only since this is my first course. But still i feel like things are going bit fast because I was not having any previous knowledge of data statistics or R language. However, giving some efforts on both sides I am happy with my performance. Thanks for the course.",3
78979,"Very mixed feelings about this course.Generally speaking, the course lectures are informative and well organized. Mentors are reallly of great help, they are doing a great job, honestly: they are very active, they give good insights, they know the subject matter.But in the course lectures, there are occasions where concepts are used which were not formally introduced before their actual use.One example: in the lectures on probability, the first ""slide"" in the lecture talks about random processes, outcomes of random process,... On the next slide, the notion of probability of an event is introduced, but the very notion of ""event"" was never introduced. It is introduced in the accompanying book, but if it is the case that the book chapters should be read PRIOR to watching the course videos, that fact should be made clear.Further in the course on probability, some words are used ""interchangeably"" without the context making it clear why they can be used interchangeably. For instance, on some occasions, the concept of independent events is used, but then, later on, the discussion talks of independent processes. Which is which??? Is there a difference? If so, what is it? When do I need to use independent events as opposed to independent processes?The graded assignments are of varying quality. The most disturbing thing about them is that, on some occasions, concepts are used in the quiz questions (either directly in the questions and answer choices, or indirectly in the ""correction"" for the quiz after you have submitted it) that were never touched upon in the course.I have had two occasions of concepts not introduced in the course but used in the graded assignments.The first occurrence of a gap between course content and quiz questions was on a quiz question about inference. I failed the question, and understood why I failed based on the course content litterally minutes after failing the question (and one mentor actually rightly corrected me). But the question ""correction"" (the explanation text you receive after submitting, as justification for what the correct answer is) referred to the concept of ""two-sided hypothesis test"". Where did THAT come from?? I checked and rechecked the course videos, no mention at all of it. I checked the accompanying book, and the first mention of two-sided hypothesis test is way way way further in the book, in a chapter that is entirely focusing on inference.The second occurrence was in week 4. The course lectures cover two distributions: normal and binomial. The recommended reading in the book also focus on these two distributions (the recommended reading actually skips the section on geometric distribution, if I remember well). But in one of the quiz question, there was one of the possible answers referring to the geometric distribution. If it is the case that we are supposed to know and understand about geometric distributions, then the course content should cover the subject. Or at the very least, the course lecture should mention clearly that learners are advised to read about it in the accompanying book.The guidelines for the project assignment (week 5) are not all that clear as to what is expected from the learners. Sure, there are instructions on where to find the info, what structure should be followed,... There is also a very nice ""example"" project (designed by one of the mentors), which provides a lot of useful info (how to filter missing values from variables,...).But there is no real hint as to the depth of analysis we are expected to complete. This is definitely a source of confusion, not only for me, but also for a few other learners, from what I gathered in the discussion forums. The result is that the projects you get to review are of very disparate levels. Some end up in calculating one figure per research question, without any attempt at deriving trends or patterns, others do not include any plots at all,... The thing is that the peer review criteria do not really provide a good basis to ensure that learners did indeed assimilate the course contents. Most of the questions in the peer review assignment have a lot more to do with following a canvas and not so much with the course substance itself.For instance, some of the peer review criteria have to do with the narratives for computed statistics and plots. The criteria are: ""Is each plot/R outout followed by a narrative"", ""Does the narrative correctly interpret the plots, or statistics"", ""Does the narrative address the research question"". But when the research question is a question of the type ""What it the IQR for income per state"", for instance, the narrative can be very short: ""IQR per state shows that the state with higher variability of income is..."". So, the narrative meets the 3 evaluation criteria: there is a narrative, it does address the research question, and it does correctly interpret the statistics. But it is not particularly useful.I do understand that Internet-based peer review is challenging, and that you have to settle for ""neutral"" criteria that are easy to assess by learners. But the peer review grading ""grid"" as it currently stands is not ""that"" helpful in assessing whether the course contents has been assimilated.To conclude, when I took the course, my initial plan was to follow the entire specialization. But after having completed the first course of the specialization, I have radically changed my mind, and will look for alternatives ""elsewhere"" to get the knowledge/skillset that I am after.",3
79012,"I took this course hoping for a fundamental education in utilizing R for statistical analysis. Unfortunately, this course focuses heavily on statistical methods and very little on explaining the R processes used. Good for introductory stats students, not great for those interested in furthering their knowledge of R.",3
79056,Nice course.But the week 5 project is a little vague. It would be beter if we had a lab assignment instead.,3
79057,"The course is OK, but in my opinion the price 69€ is higher for the material you learn.Lower price probably more people take the course payingAlso is a pitty that people we do not want to pay, we could not have a final assignement.",3
79122,"I wish they could let us take the quizzes without having to pay to verify that we have understood the lectures. However, the topic of the course and the lectures are clear and on point. Love the lessons so far!",3
79124,"Interesting overview of group psychology - but in essence just a bunch of definitions and statistics.I would have liked more focus on how the group dynamics works and how to influence these - and break the circle of unpopularity, the tools to overcome the aggressive stamp etc.Also, I found the quizzes often had unclear and ambiguous wording.Generally happy to have taken the course - but did not quite meet the description or my expectations. Off to the next :-)",3
79126,The course is way to basic and easy.,3
79175,Interesting but didn't explain in depth many of the topics.,3
79180,This is good for new born managers,3
79182,"A good overview of tools for juniors or university students just getting into things. Easy to understand.It might not have the depth satisfy more senior professionals, but could be a good refresher if not.",3
79193,"Mostly common sense, but it is a good reinforcement. I like listening to the stories/examples but they could have been shorter and the course would have felt like a more efficient use of time.",3
79199,Simple and clear explanations to solve problems.,3
79200,"Fast, efficient, not very time-consuming. However, the instructor was relatively boring and most of the material was common sense. I came out of the course learning almost nothing, but the certification looks good on my resume.",3
79201,Too abstract with too much general information,3
79208,"The content is quite interesting ,but the professor was lacking luster .",3
79209,Many points are just a presentation of bulletins with a very brief description. Could use a little more depth or at least some pointers for further study.,3
79212,Interesting overview on the topic.,3
79218,"Some interesting stuff in there.A couple of lectures need video editing though. (There is one where the lecturer says ""Let me start over"" and then starts over. The less than optimal start could be trimmed off.)",3
79222,It should show more how to implement the skills learned in real life.,3
79234,Presenter seemed a little unsure of what he was presenting by times,3
79241,"Concise but too concise I feel. Maybe it's meant for more foundation/beginner level ? Else, need more details. Not just overview.And, need more involvement/engagement from students, need multiple (randomized per attempt) questions in quizzes, need participation from course producers/TAs for questions and clarifications needed by students (in discussion forums).",3
79257,It was good insight into problem-solving in companies.,3
79265,Good course with well explained topics.,3
79267,This lecture just gave some fundamental ideals rather than details. Luckly I have not enrolled the certification.,3
79279,"The instructor is sub par,. Questions are a bit vague",3
79280,Quite useful and interesting. But not fully live up to my expectations !,3
79290,Helpful and clear.I would like it more if it had more elaboration and practice on the presented tools.Thanks!,3
79304,"Nice course, but a little ""light"" at times.What's great though is that there are no deadlines, which really enabled learning at my own pace whenever I had free time :)",3
79305,It's a good course but not great. Something is missing and I can't pinpoint what.,3
79308,"It could be better if there were more working/practice examples, but it lays down a good overview of the techniques and decision making process.",3
79329,I would say a fundamental course for VLSI.,3
79365,"Good course for beginners. I've picked up the nuances of branding via reading materials outside of this course, through my professional network, etc. and hence I was expecting more from the course.Also, I would like to mention that the quality of video lectures can significantly improve as some videos that were shot in an external location had too much noise and it was a distraction to focus on the lecture.",3
79369,Can improve.,3
79372,"It was quick, but I was expecting some more views and videos of other professionals to get the additional learning.",3
79374,It was inspiring though,3
79380,everything is there butshould be deeper for experienced persons,3
79395,The course is good! But a little bit more on social media. It will be better if we can learn more about tactics and methods of personal branding.,3

79417,"Although an excellent course, it seemed a bit too easy - not challenging enough.",3
79428,"An engaging instructor, but I was hoping for something a little more in-depth, with more rounded guidance for personal brand development.",3
79429,"This is a five week course. While it was very informative, I would have preferred longer lectures and more material to read. I finished the 5 week course in 5 days - hence making me question the value of it. In saying that, I really did enjoy it and the professor was great!",3
79430,"I did like the course BUT when you make the ""exercises"" and post something on the forums... OMG... Huge mistake... you start getting replies of EVERYTHING so... you can have 20 emails a day because other people are doing their ""exercises"" and posting on the forum, the worst is that is no way to turn off those....",3
79433,"Relevant, to the point and natural presentations",3
79441,This course will be helpful for brands / people who begin their journey with personal branding and social media. The material contains many detailed personal examples and another great value of the course is in sharing experiences in the forums.,3
79443,"Entertaining course, but only for those who are totally new to personal development and branding.",3
79447,"It is an interesting course, but mostly for beginners.",3
79452,The course should provide a free statement of accomplishment if not a verified certificate,3
79460,"Course is OK, not too informative and not too poor.",3
79462,"Helpful, but most of the information was general and could be found on any social media advice blogs. While the instructor was fun...her videos could use more graphics/powerpoints or some sort of visual instead of just straight up talking.",3
79484,Thisis a really introdutory lessons about personal branding. I think i saw good tips but could be more infos.,3
79492,"Pretty decent class but zero communication. If I could give that part a negative score I would, actually an imaginary number would be better. There are a few incorrect lecture links and errors on tests that have been pointed out dozens of times over several years now and nothing has been done whatsoever. Was also horribly misleading by stating that it was Certificate-granting when it was not, partially (not totally) fixed now but it really screwed one person I know, luckily the grade sheet seems to be sufficient proof for my purposes but if you are looking for resume material go elsewhere. For pure passive learning I would give 4.5 stars, but the lack of any instructor interaction AT ALL, and the obvious lack of attention to consistent (and totally correct) calls to fix simple errors for years now,drags it down to 3 stars in my book. Still not bad as long as you know what you are going into. I did learn a decent amount, can't deny that at all, but don't expect even the tiniest effort from anyone to help you with anything under any circumstance.",3
79556,the course seemed to be more geared to artists/composers than technicians wishing to expand or futher their skill set,3
79572,"Too short, interesting but far too short",3
79586,pretty cool course,3
79687,"I really enjoyed the assignments! And I was impressed by the teacher's track record.But the lectures were difficult to follow, and I still have no idea how to get started with nanotechnologies after this course. Wish there were more details on where/how to get started and practical examples to support it.",3
79720,"I cannot sign up for the message board -- why can't we just use Coursera's built-in one like other classes do? Also, it would be a lot nicer if we didn't have to pay to even submit quizzes to get any feedback. I feel like I should only have to pay to get the certificate or maybe a final project review. Also, I don't really think all the intro to programming stuff should be in this class. It seems like it should be a separate class, really, like explaining what a function is. Objective C is big enough on its own without trying to teach C, too. The assignments aren't very inspiring, either, although I like how simple the first one was because it got me on my computer trying to do it the first day.",3
79758,Not very proper explanation of How to use Control key with mouse to set button properties.No discussion forum,3
79813,"I would like to see the more practical information. The course is 90% built on PMBOK. I can read this guide on my own outside the course. In the course, I prefer to see how the practice corresponds with the theory.",3
79817,This was a good series for beginners.,3
79872,"Useful if you want to take PMP exam, beginner info about PM, but not very deep.",3

79927,"Just a format introduction to Project management, but good one.",3
80061,"Could be in much greater depth. Loved the video lectures: more please! Perhaps a second video lecture per week that delves into greater detail, so that the level of discussion is more in line with the PMBOK. The quizzes were simplistic, which is fine, but the final was literally just questions from the quizzes pasted together (all were repeats!) This sad fact undermines the integrity of the final as an actual test of ability and comprehension.",3
80081,"I like the materials, but I don't like that you need to pay to take the quizzes. I think that it is against the spirit of Coursera because it limits the experience of user who are willing to learn but don't have enough money to pay for the course. Many other courses allow you to take quizzes and do projects whitout paying",3
80089,The content is good but the quiz and final exam are way too easy...,3
80110,"Pros: Very clear explanations, useful slides for PMP preparation.Cons: Very easy questions and exams. Not challenging at all",3
80113,A nice intro course into what is a project and who is involved in a project. Some of the lecture material did not match the paired video which led to some confusion.,3
80116,Following are the scope of improvement -1) The flash lessons could have been provided in some kind of downloadable format (preferably PDF)2) Actual examples of Project Charter and Project Management Plan could have been provided. This would have made it easier to relate theory (of this course) with (actual) practice.,3
80132,"The course contained some valuable information, but the lack of projects even small ones didn't help much. I would prefer a small project/assignment during the last week of the course.",3
80149,Really nice but a little complex for people who just want to learn the basics. This would be very helpful for current college students as the course includes optional readings that are very informative and helpful for a deeper understanding.,3
80168,I would have liked to had more relevant examples of how to apply the concepts learned to real life scenarios.,3
80183,The site is not very user friendly. The information is good though.,3
80186,I would have liked better tools to do this type of work.,3
80197,"Good course, easy to follow. Stayed away from complicated, deep-dives of information",3
80204,"A bit confusing in term of structure. We jumped from some sections of the project life cycle to others missing some others. It gave a good general picture of what project management is about. But I'm not quite sure which is the order I should follow when dealing with a project. However I have to say I didn't do the optional readings. At least not yet!Anyway, I think is an overall good course for not initiated people like me",3
80205,more practical projects&homework would be great!,3
80246,"I watched the entire set of week one lectures, and sadly I do not think this is up to scratch with the rest of the material on Coursera. The presentation is not consistent: there are slides, web cam videos, animations, and it just feels like the course is a mish mash. The University of Adelaide is running a similar course on a well known competitor site, so I have signed up to that.",3
80253,test questions far too easyslide show lessons not well structured and too focussed on repetetive concepts,3
80256,"It's a good course, if you're looking to learn the basics of planning projects, and it doesn't take more than a day to complete, it's just a bit of reading.",3
80265,"Material is very detailed which is both a positive and negative. It gets a little redundant and some things are just common sense. You can tell the instructor is trying to be upbeat but is very clearly reading off of ""cue cards"" so it's a little flat. For a free course you get a lot of information and it is very easy to get a 100 on every quiz.",3
80272,"Informative and clearly structured course. However, its content is aimed at professional project managers - useful but not exactly what I was looking for !",3
80273,Good way to refresh your knowledge about PMP .. but not qualifying as a professional course,3
80289,I think the discussion on initiating and planning projects could be improved to be a bit more comprehensive and It would be great if the lecture slides were downloadable.,3
80301,"The course is great resource of information. The biggest drawback is the need of using Flash to view most of the lecture. This limited my ability to went through the course on time - I ""attend"" Coursera courses using my iPhone while commuting and it is not possible for this course.",3
80311,"It isn't as engaging as I thought it would be. Since this is an introductory course, it would have helped if this were more interactive to build the interest for the latter courses.",3
80312,"The course, as intended probably, is theoretical and gives a good snapshot of project management. Following the PMBOK guide and covering all the relevant portions in the limited time deserves an applause. The only area of improvement, I felt, was the case study.It could have been a little more detailed and has scope of increased level of difficulty. A good course overall and beneficial in almost all walks of work :) Thank you !",3
80325,"Very informative, and easy to follow format.",3
80326,Need to me more technical. It was covering very basic concepts,3
80409,Good basic overview. Not groundbreaking content or presentation compared to courses featuring Steve Blank or leaders from Google.,3
80415,It is targeted to business negotiations.,3
80426,ok course. nothing more,3
80468,"Nice course with many tips, but very enterprise and US oriented. To be expected, but still I would have liked some more day-to-day aspects coming up. It is possible to adapt most tips but I think that could enrich the course.The teaching voice should be more active. Felt like a falling asleep university course. A negotiator should be a more fluid speaker (in my humble opinion, not an expert in any ways).",3
80479,It's better to just read the transcripts than watch the painfully boring videos. If you don't have an interest in law then you won't find this class very interesting. I thought the information was good but could have been better presented.,3
80641,Too much law for non lawyers,3
80662,"Good material and final. Quizzes at the end of each week would be helpful. Also, the videos could have been quite a bit shorter.",3
80685,"The final negotiation homework was very interesting, and useful in internalizing the concepts. I didn't like the fact that the course spent a lot of time covering legal topics. Perhaps due to the instructor's legal background. I wish there were practical recommendations on salary negotiation.",3
80752,I struggled a lot with the presenter of this course. The presentation was quite fluffy yet the book is direct and straight to the point on the theory of negotiations.,3
80904,"Enjoyed the professor, but there was lots of fluff and ultimately spent far too much time focusing on legalities and minor details and less on actually imparting negotiating skills.",3
80912,"The course is interesting, but in the other hand is too basic, If you already have some knowledge about negotiationg it wont give you a lot of knowledge.",3
80999,"This course has amazing breath. Most other specializations are organized chronologically (i.e. Course 1: Learn Ruby, Course 2: learn about databases with rails, Course 3: Learn about HTML,CSS, JS, etc.) But this introductory course describes everything that goes into making web applications, from front end to back end and compares ruby on rails to the other major frameworks. If you're just trying to get started learning WebApps, as I was, this is very useful.The reason I couldn't give it 5 stars was that there weren't very useful assignments. You learn programming best from doing projects. In this course, there were a few quizes (which aren't as nearly as useful as projects) and the only projects that existed were to simply follow the steps exactly as the professor did in his videos. I think that the makers of the course are 90% of the way to a top course, they just need to add in programming assignments for each week, where you don't just follow the professor. I learned a lot from this course, but without getting the programming projects and exercises needed to reinforce the understanding, it may be hard to retain some of the knowledge.",3
81018,It's satisfactory but I recommend reading the book.,3
81080,"This course really helps me understand the basic logic behind the modern macro business world. The focus on the history of economic schools and world economy is a highlight which provides lively background for the dull economic concepts. But the blame on China for the sluggish US and world economy is very biased and selectively blind, because Prof. Peter Navarro is Trump's economic advisor. When he blames China for everything, he forgot one fact that the 2008 Financial Crisis and the resulting world recession were initially caused by the US, not China. I respect Pro. Peter Navarro and really appreciate his teaching, but I don't think mixing too much personal bias into the public course is responsible and objective, and that's why I took two stars off.",3
81096,"I have to admit, this course greatly disappointed me from the beginning. The main reason is its title; it should have been ""Macroeconomics of the USA"". The instructor focuses too heavily on the US economy, which is partially understandable due to its significance, but I personally got tired of the endless supply of facts (and opinions) about US Presidents and their choices on US Macroeconomic Policy over the last 80 years.Other than that, the main concepts of Macroeconomics are presented with adequate detail. I had very little background in Economics but managed to grasp them rather easily. The presentations are pretty dull, however, with the professor mainly reading through the slides (which mind you are NOT in downloadable form).All in all, it's not a bad course, but there is great room for improvement.",3
81098,I am having difficulty in understanding it.The concepts go by way too fast..,3
81110,I felt overwhelmed by too much information all of a sudden in each lesson.,3
81172,Presentation slides could've been better prepared. The quiz could've thrown the right answers after finishing. But it was very informative overall,3
81185,"The course discussed a great deal of very important information, but the instruction was very rushed, and often lacked the specific details needed - for example, formulas were sometimes left out, and it was assumed you could/would just ""figure it out."" The quizzes were very detailed and specific - which I do not disagree with - but I feel as though they sometimes focused on minutiae rather than large or critical concepts.There were also several spelling and grammar mistakes throughout the quizzes.",3
81188,"It presents a lot of different aspect of macro economics in a really short time which is good. But because of that, it doesn't give a good understandings of each problem.Nice introduction, but I will start another class on the subject which I would have liked to avoid.",3
81216,Is not a completed and structured course. It needs more examples to get the idea exactly,3
81240,nice course but i did not recieved my certificate yet,3
81263,"The lectures and resources are good quality and offer a lot of information. However, the peer reviewed assignment needs revising.I submitted all the assignments early for the course, making sure to get in my peer reviewed assignment a week early to ensure that if I needed to, I could resubmit and have time for grading. I did not receive a grade on my assignment until after the deadline was passed. My assignment was mis-reviewed by my peers, clearly they did not read my paper, they just clicked randomly at the grading options. This caused me to fail by a few percentage points. I resubmitted my assignment that day, highlighting the content the graders missed. I still do not have a grade on this assignment and fear I will fail the class.The reason I bring this up in my review is that there is no contact information for the instructor. There is no process to dispute the grade. The assignment needs an overhaul if you expect people to take the assignment to pass the class.",3
81296,Assignments flawed and need reviewing.,3
81298,"Course itself is excellent, cases are very good and practical, but the only thing is lots of technical issues with the assignments and quizzes. Therefore only 3 stars.",3
81299,"Still a very interesting course, but a few technical problems with test and forums.",3
81330,"the course, probably, was good, but it was presented in rather boring and slow manner, so in the end I completely lost interest, and was skipping through the lectures.If it could be done in more lively and engaging manner, it would have been great",3
81379,Good course but not enough new information and knowledge as expected,3
81389,"the presentation was needed to be change a little bit, to get the postive attention",3
81401,"It is a very interesting course. I was quite taken.The teacher is good in her solos, and quite good while in the group. I dind't really like the massive use of the terms ""kind of"" (often used to explain concepts) and for this reason I still have to finish it.I will quickly 'cause I 'm looking forward to learning something else.",3
81408,"The material here is good, especially for a MOOC, and it seemed like they tried to make it dynamic with the use of questions, discussion, interviews, and extension activities. I'm disappointed, however, that the course focused so heavily on Frederickson's work to the exclusion of others. While I understand that this is where she would feel the most comfortable and familiar, to start with her broaden-and-build theory and continually reference her lab's work, with the additional readings often being her books, it felt limited. I would have liked more of a discussion of the contributions of other psychologists like Seligman, Csikszentmihalyi, Peterson, Diener, Lyubomirsky, etc. Along with that, it could have addressed topics other than emotions (or been titled The Positive Psychology of Emotions), like character strengths, flow, or institution change. I love the fact that this course exists, and it's a good foundation to build on, but it still feels too narrow to claim the title Positive Psychology.",3
81417,Even though I liked how the teacher conducted her course in a dinamic way with 4 participants I expected more from this course.,3
81435,Good. Easy to understand with simple exercises. Lots of things are learnt. But better be more interesting with more ways of presenting and showing.,3
81514,"It's a good course and the contents are very helpful. There are important components like negativity bias and loving-kindness meditation. However I somehow feel it lacks a more systematic or scientific approach since lots of the materials goes on with a free and open discussion that very much depends on subjective views or feelings of selected individuals who joined the discussion. Take another example, ""What is Love"" session clearly depends an individual's own view. It contradicts ""triangular theory of love"" and the lecturer doesn't even explain why.",3
81532,"Interesting subject, but I think it can delivered in more interactive ways. It fulls of conversation with the same setting. For instance, It will be more interesting if we put in different setting of conversation.",3
81533,"This did not grab my attention like I thought it would. I did not finish the course, but the assignments were entirely too pointless for me to take seriously enough to continue. I very much enjoyed the idea of studying positive Psychology, but after a few class I realized it was very much common sense.",3
81566,A good basic course for positive psychology. Really like the panel discussion and the interactive questions. Do find it is a bit too basic for people who are in the psychology field. But recommended for people who want an introduction to positive psychology.,3
81611,"the set up for the course was choppy, with random intervals of questions. could definitely flow better",3
81621,"A good course, but maybe a little lacking in depth.",3
81637,"Really a good course for people who suffers a lot in modern society. Some ways to cultivate positive emotions on this course really help me a lot. And the most important thing while learning this course is to practicing and applying it into reality, which is really amazing~~",3
81639,"The information is really great, but the format was tedious and dull. Ws hard to really get interested in the information in the way that it was presented. Contrast this with the Happiness course for a clue as to how to make the information more interesting and compelling as far as presentation is concerned.",3
81651,"the way this course was presented was quite unique: watching a few people from various walks of life (but most related to the University) discuss various topic and exchange opinion and experiences about positivity.I liked the material provided for meditation about loving kindness and I have been using it on a daily (well 5 days a week) basis.why I gave only 3 stars:the material was overall rather shallow - after reading about positive psychology, I still very little substance it has to offer.in addition. Barbare is not the greatest and most charismatic speaker in the world, although she did surprise me in her TED talk.in general, human emotions are operating on a scale from positive to negative. Positive Psychology takes a one-sided approach by looking only on the plus side. That is about as incomplete as the approach of focusing only on the pathology. To fully grasp a human being, there must be a third way? is it philosophy?",3
81662,a bit boring lectures,3
81681,"The course is interesting, the professors are good, they know how and what they have to explain. But the exercises and tests are really easy and do not require lots of knowledge. In fact, seems more like an explanation than a test. So, if you don't practice by yourself you won't learn a thing. Even though Coursera give you an certificate.I would add more and better practical exercises to make this course better.",3
81686,Way too basic.A bit more realistic and complex practice assignments will enrich the course.,3
81732,"very much interesting and hand on map of yourself or your hobby. it provide you a good and exact command that's required for you to make a good web page. so go for it , professor are very cool.",3
81756,increase the difficulties,3
81803,Not BAD!,3
81817,"I was a little lost during projects, there no extensive videos for languages but on the other hand there was good materials and refereed links that could help.",3
81829,It was very interesting and quite simple to follow!Indicative for beginners!,3
81898,"Words... TOO MANY Words!! Talking talking talking, most if it without valuable content. I got bored listening to the instructors continuously telling us what they were going to tell us, repeating themselves, and then telling us what they told us again and again and again... Also WAY too many UMMMMsss from the instructors.",3
81899,"A nice introduction to HTML, CSS and JavaScript.",3
81906,very easy,3
81923,cool,3
81951,"In my opinion, this is a decent introductory course but I feel it relies too heavily on the bootstrap framework and not enough basic fundamentals are taught. There is a lot happening within any framework and understanding the how, and why of web design is just as important as getting the final product.",3
81954,"Needs way bigger scope and a bit more going into details. The Full Stack Web Development course is somewhat like that. Lectures are good and easy to understand, both visuals and speak are nice and clear. Hopefully next one remains great quality but with more content :)",3
81960,"As a learning course the final project was specification-less. they should ask for something specific and explained well they should test conecpts not asking for whatever idea you have, apply what you learned I think this is an old school method.",3
81974,"Not that bad I've might have learned more visiting other MOOC like Openclassrooms where they give us more information about coding. This course is just showing the basic, not as complete as other online course platform where they show you how to insert video, contact form and audio.",3
81976,"Html and CSS were excellent!I'm sure this is a great course for people with some coding background, but as a complete beginner to Javascript and coding, I found it nearly impossible to comprehend the 3rd and 4th weeks because we jumped in to Jquery without first getting to know Javascript.Yes - the quizzes were too easy - I passed all of them even when I wasn't understanding most of the material.I went over to CodeAcademy and Microsoft Virtual Academy to get a better foundation in JS, then came back and was able to understand a bit better. As for me, I am going to spend more time learning and practicing JS/JQ before moving on to the next course in this specialization.",3
81979,A nice introduction to the basics but I found the assignments a little to easy so I didn't feel competent at the end of the course. I thought the instructors gave the information in clear and concise way which made the course quite enjoyable,3
81988,"Course is really helpful for whom start develop website, however, question set is too small so student can guess its answer in few trial (I don't like it).At the end, I admire your effort in these series and will keep joining the next course.",3
82015,"I believe the two first modules (html, css) are way too basic to really learn anything. The javascript segment is better because the concepts are explained more in depth.",3
82041,Could have covered more areas and with more examples for features. Not bad for what it is to serve as guidance.,3
82042,Somehow crumpled and not helpful,3
82051,"Good foundation, but very basic.",3
82066,Exercises should be more tough so that students can read a lot on the web about different thingsthey could do with Javascript. Hands-on experience should be given to be more interactive.,3
82082,"Sometimes the teacher only shortly mentions things and then goes on with major exlanations about other things. Which is fine because I assume he will go deeper into the material later on. But when we had to do the final exam (for week 2), they asked questions about ""what happens if there are two commands in the brackets"" (like this .changeme .changemeagain). The teacher never ever mentioned that the first command is the most important one and the second is a kind of 'fallback', for example. And even if he did mention it, it was only a kind of sidenoteand did not seem that important. So, all in all, I really do like this course, but instructions aren't always super clear.",3
82089,"The course could and should have digs a hole lot deeper into the material, a brief history of the web, the browser, wars standards compliance, I feel, should have been part of this course. Web-standards in general also, html/css/js versions which just have new versions or upcoming versions should have been presented and/or relevant links provided.This course if full of missed opportunities.",3
82091,The teacher speaks very fast and provides the material not deep!,3
82124,"Too much time is dedicated to the very basics. It could have been shorter and more concise. I opted out of this course in favour of the one from the Hong Cong University, sorry =)",3
82128,The assignments were not very challenging nor were the lectures very in depth.,3
82129,"It's a very basic course to learn a very small things about bootstrap, jquery and HTML, but I think the level is too advanced for non-programming people, it should be better structured.",3
82133,"Use this course to reinforce your front end skills and not to learn for the first time. There's too many gaps in the presented content for a beginner. The video and audio were presented in a professional high quality format that you would expect from a major university. However, the course structure was slightly unorganized and didn't flow as well as other courses of similar content. Sometimes the instructors seemed to be at a loss for words and stumbled along with arms flailing. At 2X speed it's very obvious and entertaining.It was a fair attempt for their first online Coursera Web Development course. Hopefully, University of London will improve with future courses.",3
82134,"Plus: responsive web programming, notions of bootstrap and jQueryNegative: ultra-beginner level, very low-level basics, not much hands-on use of HTML/CSS/JS",3
82139,Light introduction using jQuery and Bootstrap as shortcuts.,3
82142,"This course have excellent title but not that great contents. It touched html, css, javascript, bootstrap and jquery most of part as just touched. contents are too less",3
82154,The course feels too rushed/condensed for someone with no real scripting/coding background. I honestly felt this course wasn't for me because I wasn't learning enough.,3
82157,Great video instructions. Had some tech issues on my end. Not really a good idea to try this on a chromebook if you are just getting started. If you know the work-arounds to make the assignments with a chromebook it's below your level. Still very much worth the time to watch the videos whether or not you are going to complete the work.,3
82161,Got really bonkers listening to the University of London jingle at the start AND end of each of the 38 video's in this course. The content is just ok.. but not explanation is very high level. It is good for someone who has never had experience with web technologies before.,3
82172,Its a really a nice course.,3
82202,Good material and practical ideas for the day-to-day use at work.,3
82203,Too much reading material and too few videos.,3
82208,"Good course , could be made better ! content is good and simple !",3
82229,"I would have been great to have more examples of the different types of corruption, the analysis to fight it and the solutions behind it. A case-study method I believe is optimal for this subject.",3
82279,The tutorials lack in depth explanation of methods work. This is not a university level course. its more like here is how to do it magically. There is no explanation on how the methods work. or how the meteor achieve what it does.,3
82302,"Liked this course, entertaining and challenging. Although Im not sure how useful meteor is in the real world.",3
82304,very good as intro,3
82306,"Videos are easy to understand and follow, but there's sometimes to little background knowledge about writing good apps, security and good practices. The communication with the server and what would look like the final working product is not explained at all.",3
82331,"A bit old version of Meteor, but a good course for basics.Saddly this old version and the way we done, gonna be deprecated soon.",3
82336,"The production of this course could be much clearer and as such this is a very tedious course. The actual subject matter is good if you have some experience with JavaScript. The video is constantly switching between the professor and the code. As such, you'll find yourself constantly replaying certain parts to see what is typed. In some instances, the code is actually ""off-screen"". Is there really any value to seeing the professor (rather than just hearing)? The key information is in the code! Either leave the video on the code the entire time and run the audio for the teacher, or, add another window where the live code is visible the entire time. It's important that this is the live code. Simply providing the final product doesn't allow the novice user to see how it is built.",3
82343,Lack of exercises and communication.,3
82374,"Very concise contents, and a practical approach to Meteorjs",3
82430,Was only videos and 2 question quizzes until the very end. I was very surprised by the assignment at the end as it was never mentioned in any of the videos. Almost didn't finish it in time because it was due right after Christmas.Would like more hands-on assignments throughout the course instead of one at the end.,3
82438,"Full of great information, but still a bit in ""beta"" stage. Just like the other courses in this specialization, it has more than a few kinks that still need to be worked out. I would be upset if I had paid for this, but I'm glad to learn about meteor in a free and structured way.",3
82461,"Great course but the final assignment is really tough. Hence, it would be great if more examples were given and the inclusion of an additional assignment at wk 2 would help too.",3
82484,"Several papers for the course are behind pay walls. No one seems to monitor the forums on an ongoing basis. As someone new to the field of molecular genetics, I took the course to learn about the seminal work. I found the context and explanations by the professor to be very helpful.",3
82497,Content is good but honours assignments are unclear and no help from mentors in the discussion forums - more time-consuming than they should be,3
82499,Can't get score for free!!!,3
82510,Good overall review: I encountered stuff I did not know before. Just a little highbrow.,3
82511,"A class on Modern American Poetry and Ezra Pound was only treated secondarily? Crazy!As well, much of my time on recommended reading was spent looking for the poetry. Why are there no links to the poetry we are learning about?",3
82513,"This iteration of the course (August-September 2016) fizzled because so few students were actively participating. Early in the course, I worked diligently on my written contributions to the discussion forums, but then there was so little peer response that I gradually came to understand that I was mostly just talking to myself. Halfway through the course, I gave up on the forums.But I read all the poems, viewed the videos and took the quizzes. The quizzes are lame, the poetry selection is great, and the video lectures are all worthwhile.I had initial misgivings about some of the videos. The improvised round-table discussions of meta-poems by Dickinson, Stevens and Mullen (module 4, lesson 4) initially seemed too colloquial and not incisive, but then I realized they had value as models for how to grope into an initial understanding of a strange poem. The lecture on Hart Crane (module 1, lesson 4) was too difficult for me to follow in real-time spoken form, but then I found I could understand some of it by frequently stopping and starting the video, re-reading the lecture text in transcript, and taking long breaks for careful review of Crane's verse and for research about some of its allusions and associations. That lecture might have made more sense in purely written form, and I wonder if it was so daunting that it scared off some of the students who started the course.As a whole, the course managed a satisfying balance between discussion of the poetry itself and discussion of the social and economic contexts in which the poetry was created and consumed. I especially appreciated the clarity of Karen Ford's many lectures and Tim Newcomb's lively and enthusiastic investigation of the role of little magazines in the 1910s & 1920s.",3
82515,A pretty good overview of modern poetry. Very high on generalities and low on details - like detailed readings of individual poems.The fact the the majority of the instructors just read their lectures and many of them never look up at the camera at all makes this seem very lazy and impersonal. There's very little of the engagement that would really make this interesting.,3
82519,"Terrific course! terrible translations! everything you need to know starts here and its great, but the quizzes are so awful that I found myself translating it back to English to figure it out what the questions mean",3
82557,"It's a good course for those that are seeking to improve their grammar skills in English, but for me it sounded a little superficial and the peer review system for this course left space for some subjectivity.",3
82601,In general I like the course but I find it a bit boring. I wish it was organized in a more interactive way.,3
82613,nice course but i was expecting more about actors and futures,3
82624,It is a good course. I took it after Functional Programming Principles in Scala. I learned new things....But..... The reason i rate 3 is that:1) Programminng Assignments doesn't realy correspond to the Lecture material.2) The Lecture material becomes very complicated in some Lectures because of Lack of Explanation (e.g: Lec 4.3. There are still many disambiguations of how the Prof. creates some models (again lack of explanation)3) Too many unanswered critical questions remain in the forum!!!Anyway it's worth your time.,3
82635,"Too much of the content is already contained in the courses ""Functional Programming Principles in Scala"" and ""Principles of Reactive Programming"". Would be nice to have some new assignments.",3
82637,"Good topics, just poorly structured. I found the exercises easier than the previous module, but the lectures were worse. I ended up watching 1 lecture on week 3 and again on week 4 -- none of the other lecture content was relevant to the exercises. Would have loved a decent explanation of a Monad and their usages, but it really felt out of place in this course (no exercises on Monads).After completing the first two courses I don't feel like I would bother with the next ones. The course content is far to academic and I would get far more from a book.",3
82642,"This course was significantly less instructive than the first. Assignments did not lead me as constructively through the material. Also the few videos with the other lecturer in week 4 are very confusing, hard to understand, or even appreciate in light of all the other material. I do not think that I have understood futures and am glad it was not required for the last assignment as the answers aren't present in the material.",3
82643,"The last week has materials that nothing related to assignment, and it jumps a bit fast where i have no clue at all",3
82655,"Last week's content was thrown together from various bits & parts from the Functional Reactive Programming in Scala (or whatever the name of the predecessor of this course was).Overall, I felt that there was a lot of ground covered in a short amount of time - the course would have been better if it was longer, and week 4 material would have benefitted from being stretched into two or three weeks. Rather than reuse parts of the old course it would have been better to have new content purpose built for this course.",3
82660,"I have seen reference to the previous second course on the specialization, 'Functional Reactive Programming in Scala', comparatively this one looks much easied down, I am hoping to find the excluded content on the third course. Sessions by Erik surely are a 100% pertinent and consistent within the full syllabus they were conceived for, but inserted here they break a bit the overall discourse, in my view. Got the feeling that the exercises cover only a little part of the theoretical content exposed in the lectures.",3
82662,Thoroughly enjoyed the lectures by M. Odersky! Unfortunately the lectures on Futures seemed a bit disconnected from the rest of the material...,3
82672,"Meh. Very basic intro; not the more advanced class I anticipated, based on the first in the sequence.",3
82673,Week 3 assigment had little relationship with the material presented in the course. Week 4 needs quite a lot of polish...,3
82675,progfun and reactive programming was better,3
82676,"A daily demanding course, which could have benefitted from more time spent in some areas - particular signals. The video explaining a sample Signal implementation was very rushed and provided too little detail on a lot of information that seems to be taken for granted.",3
82680,"Fantastic topic on itself, yet delivered in a rushed manner. Programming assignments are of uneven difficulty. The second assignment is all about a testing framework usage, not really aimed towards Functional Design at all. Feels like the material worth 10 weeks was crammed into 4 weeks.You can still learn some important conceptions, so it is not a total waste of your time.",3
82681,I was expecting this course to be more challenging than Functional Programming Principles in Scala but found this one easier in the end. The assignments were ok but I felt like they could have been more challenging and also that they should have tested my understanding of the course contents more thoroughly.,3
82682,"Not as good as the first one, esp near the end.",3
82686,The videos were a bit confusing and gave me the impression that it was a patchwork from old lectures.,3
82687,Asigments are too easy to implement,3
82692,"Learned quite a bit, but course was not as good as the first course of the specialization.Especially the presentations in week 4 are rather messy.",3
82694,Videos from previuos version of the course Reactive programming in Scala makes this course worse prepared. I had impression that it was made rushed from shredded pieces. Assignements are easier than previous,3
82705,"The content was pretty good, but I'm annoyed that I paid for a disjointed collection of videos that were previously available for free. This is just a pared down (worse) version of an older class, ""Principles of Reactive Programming"", which I started but didn't finish three years ago. The videos and assignments are the same, but some of them have been removed, so there are confusing discontinuities. Some of the videos refer to a ""next lecture"" or ""previous lecture"", which isn't included in this class. The last week of the class should have been split across multiple weeks, and I'm disappointed I never got to do an assignment on latency or futures.That being said, I'd still recommend taking any class taught by Odersky, and I learned a fair amount.",3
82718,On the positive side: The content was very interesting.On the negative side: The course was not particularly well structured. The last week was quite difficult to follow.,3
82722,"The course needs a reboot. Some parts were merged with other and the whole thing lacks continuity. A few examples were poorly chosen. For instance, signals / reactive concepts would be easier to understand in user interfaces or graphics / games.",3
82726,"Was quite good but getting less and less useful, too abstract, lacking detail. Examples too academic, needs to be more practical.",3
82728,"Decent course, except in the last week it felt a bit stitched together from parts of a previous course and a new one. The jump in flow seemed abrupt and the relevance of some of the contents (regarding Future's) was not clear.",3
82731,"The topics are great, the material is not really polished: the lectures are from previous courses and they reorganised material without redoing anything, which is needed in several points. Many explanations could be improved greatly.",3
82732,Course material looked sometimes recycled and unstructered,3
82737,The old version was more interesting.,3
82740,This course has some really good material but the way it has been presented is very disjointed and does not really do the job of properly illustrating Functional Program Design. Although topics such as Signal and FRP are interesting they serve little value in day to day use and assignments focusing on Futures would be far more beneficial.,3
82745,Worse than Scala Principles - too chaotic.,3
82747,I was expecting more from it.,3
82748,"Interesting course. Not sure it really covers functional programming design, it feels more of a brief introduction. The material is clearly a cut & paste from a different (and I guess longer) course. There were references to non-existing weeks, and to subjects that were not part of this course. That felt a bit cheap, considering that courses are not really free anymore. Positive experience, but not exceptional.",3
82758,The main difficulty of the task does not apply to the course,3
82759,Not as useful as the first course. The part on the futures is not really understandable.,3
82771,"The subject is really interesting, and some of the shown approaches really ""close to the edge"".However, there is too much ""cut and paste"" from other courses. this makes this one difficult to follow. It has lost ""coherence"". The cross-references don't make any sense, and the assignments fall too short with regard to the content. I think the remake from the original ""Functional Programming ___ in Scala"" + ""Reactive Programming"" has not been as successful as it should. This new format within Coursera (everything shorter, more expensive and with less people involved) is not as good as the original one. Maybe this is the only way they can make enough money to sustain the whole... but the ""more idealistic"" start was far more pleasant.",3
82772,Much of the lecture material seemed very chopped-up from previous courses and did not flow well at all. In a couple of cases the assignment had very little relationship with the course material from the same week.,3
82773,"The course in general is not as good as Martin Odersky's first course, but it still has interesting bits to learn about functional programming.Everything topic feels very disconnected to each other.Lastly, the last part of the course is specially disorganized. I didn't feel like the assignment captured everthing that was taught.",3
82804,"Interesting, but a little bit too easy and shallow.The material was reused from other courses without making it all fit together well.",3
82816,"If you're new to Scala and/or functional programming, then the material covered here will be very valuable.However, I was fairly disappointed. Much of the coursework was pulled from the original ""Functional Programming in Scala"" course, as well as the ""Principles of Reactive Programming"" course. Indeed, there are references to material from those courses that are not actually included here, which must be a little confusing for anyone who hasn't taken those courses. The first two assignments came, respectively, from those two courses also.There wasn't as much emphasis on architecting a functional program as I might have expected from the title. Instead, the course focused more on using functional principles when implementing computations. The coverage of functional reactive programming (FRP) was very good, but again, I would have expected more of a 30,000ft overview of how to design an application using FRP.In short, I felt this course to be a little incoherent and disjointed.",3
82821,Most of the content was included in Functional Programming in Scala and Reactive Programming Principles in Scala.,3
82825,It was an interesting class but the quizzes did not reflect the class material.,3
82829,"Interesting material but the instructor was so monotone and spoke so slowly, I had to play the videos at a faster speed to stay awake. I'll bet it came in handy for those whose English was not as fluent, though.",3
82839,"Great topic, but the course was less interesting and profound than I expected. The professor could be a little more motivating. Worth the time though!",3
82845,"I feel this course is designed in a way that may be too challenging to those who know nothing about music, sound, or biology. The quizzes dont really match the material covered and some of the questions are too ambiguous. The explanations are a little hard to follow as well. It does cover some interesting information about the relationship of music to speech. However, for someone a little more advanced in music and biology, I was hoping for more to be covered. I would have enjoyed more discussion of the history of modes and tuning systems, including more discussion of the Pythagorean comma (and how adjusted need to be made to intervals, especially in a chorus) and Kepler's work. I also would have enjoyed more discussion of rhythmic entrainment, the social cohesion hypothesis of the evolution of music, the roles music plays in human life, the way that bodies synchronize, and more about the relationship of music to emotional regulation, meaning, and personality. Im sure there is more as well. Giving this course 3 stars is generous in my opinion.",3
82846,The instructor is very dry and the mat,3
82850,I did enjoy the course enough to see it through but it could use help on presentation correlation of lessons and tests,3
82851,"The second part of the course is very good. But first part, with introductions and definitions were very ""heavy"".",3
82854,Potentially interesting and useful material presented in boring and sometimes unclear manner. Quizzes failed to correlate to the material in the lectures. Got something out of the course but the potential was there for much more.,3
82855,"The course was alright in the sense that it was descriptive, however, the level of critical thinking suggested for the course was not actually indicative of the material presented.A lot of the material presented was great, but when the quiz came around, questions regarding the material were unequal. For example, in one quiz, there was a question about Galileo, but there was no mention of Galileo in the lecture for that week, and, a lot of the PDF'S were repetitive and not diverse in the material being taught.",3
82858,"A five-week class on biological mechanisms of perception of speech and music by humans. The topics include sound signals and sound stimuli and their perception with the human auditory system, differences and likelihood in the perception of vocalization and vocal tones in speech and of music, biological interpretation of scales, and the impact of cultural differences onto music.The course is rather a prolonged description of the research field than a proper part of general education. Its real subject is certain topics in biology, not music. Only a number facts discussed may be of interest for most music student, and these are contained in any decent introductory textbook of music anyhow.",3
82862,"The material in this course is very interesting, and many of the musical demonstrations are extremely helpful. I am glad I took it. However, much of the most interesting material is poorly explained; I would loved if fewer ideas were covered in more depth. The quizzes were for the most part poorly written, and only somewhat correlated with the presentation of material in the lectures. So there is definitely much room for improvement.",3
82864,This course fills a gap that is rarely taught by explaining biological origins of musical experiences. The material is very easy to follow. I wish there were more practical exercises or home works to play with the concepts.,3
82870,"Im glad I god new knowledge. My view of the course is that Its very theoretical, but not necessary needs to be be. It could benefit with som illustrations for the achy types, since its already around. With some use of either tv-shows or cartoons it can be clear what it means for the types. However this is only my view and to make it even better. Thanks",3
82874,"The course content was slightly repetitive and the information on the Myers-Briggs personality types can be found online. It is such a pity that payment must be made to access the graded coursework, preventing one from completing the course if one chooses not to pay.",3
82890,Lacks the hands on learning experience i was looking for but a great overview.,3
82891,"It was interesting and informative course. However, I found difficulty in relating lessons and get true meaning of the course",3
82894,very insightful,3
82933,The course touches briefly on all the relevant concepts but it remains at a very introductory level.I would recommend it only for student without any previous exposure to the subjects.,3
82946,"Too theoretical and too few practical, real life case studies (the main ones are health and domestic worker campaign). This course is more suited for an academic rather than a PR campaigner.",3
82986,The concepts are very good but very theoretical.More quantitative analysis should be added to prepare students to deal with the real world problems.,3
82987,"the course is very useful, but the video lessons are very very short, no enough examples, forums also need presence of tutor for help .... it would be of better value specially that comes from great professors...i really thank professors for their efforts",3
82988,Not enough students to give review grading and earn a grade.,3
82996,"A few of the programming projects were a bit tedious. If you're not passionate about games like tic tac toe, it's hard to maintain focus :) I love the teaching however, very well done as usual!",3
83012,"This course was solid overall but not excellent. I learned the basics of different classes of probabilistic models including Bayesian networks and Markov networks and how to represent them. Prof. Koller is knowledgeable and presented the materially logically. With that said, this course could have been a lot better than it was.The honors programming assignments could have been excellent The material was interesting and dovetailed well with the course content. But the assessment process was very frustrating and led to a lot of wasted time debugging that was geared more to quirks of the grader than to course concepts. Both test cases and feedback on failed submissions were woefully inadequate. Some of the quizzes were also frustrating, featuring what I consider to be ""gotcha"" questions geared more to creating a grading curve than to measuring understanding of the material.Advice to course staff: (1) Please provide more test cases on coding assignments (2) Please provide better feedback in submission reports (3) Please monitor the discussion boards more actively for unanswered questions (4) If you want to provide an externally linked executable you intend students to run from Matlab, it's not reasonable to give a 32 bit file in 2017 and send us down a rabbit hole where you suggest we build the executable from source, which in turn requires us to build the boost library from source.",3
83024,"This is an amazing course, and taught by an extremely talented and accomplished professor. I believe it's a must for anyone in AI/ML or Statistical Inference. The problem is that you're essentially on your own the entire course. There isn't any community or TA help to speak off. And the project is done in Matlab, so you end up wrestling with Matlab or Octave instead of actually doing and learning. I still recommend the course, but that's only because the material is so extremely important.",3
83027,"Concepts covered in quiz and assignments are not covered well in the lecture videos, can be much better.",3
83045,The audio is VERY VERY poor.That makes it very hard to understand what Prof Kohler is trying to impart on us..I often lost track,3
83051,"I found plenty of useful information in this course overall but lectures often spent too much time dwelling on the detail of simpler concepts while more complex areas, and sometimes critical information that was later built upon, were only touched briefly or sometimes skipped entirely. I missed a sense of continuity as we skipped from model to model with a minimum of time spent on how the models complement each other and their relative strengths and weaknesses in application.The way data structures were defined in the code was particularly difficult to deal with. The coding exercises all suffered as a result. It ended up taking way too much time to figure how to decode the data and trace logic around it. This meant that grasping concepts and learning from the questions came in a distant second priority to debugging.Dr Koller mentioned that the material is aimed at postgraduates. I felt that the level of content covered here would just as easily be grasped by most undergraduates in technical disciplines if it had been delivered in a more structured manner with clearer progression across models (conceptually and mathematically) and better code examples. When delivering in this format, allowances need to be made for the facts that tutorial sessions do not exist and the possibilities for informal Q&A are limited so any gaps become very difficult for students to fill in themselves.Despite the above shortcomings I'm glad I did the course and I would still recommend it to someone interested in graphical models as it does cover the basics well enough to make a decent start. I'm not sure whether or not I'd recommend the programming exercises as they are a significant time sink but at the same time, without spending time attacking the programming problems the concepts are not likely to gel based on the video and quizzes alone.",3
83053,"The course was very interesting and thought-provoking. I found the introduction to probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) and their properties struck a nice balance between intuition and formalism. The discussions highlighted exciting aspects of their power in simplifying complex problems involving uncertainty. However, I still do not feel I could propose convincing PGMs for real-world problems. There are examples in the course, but they are far removed from being concrete applications. I would have preferred there be an in depth analysis of an application of PGMs in the literature over the lengthy programming assignments. I am an experienced programmer with over 5 years of experience in many languages including MATLAB/Octave and I sometimes found it uninspiring to solve toy problems, not due to the difficulty in using the programming language, but rather because after the assignment had been completed I felt I had not really learnt much more than I would have from just watching the lectures, although, if you are interested in getting experience with MATLAB/Octave, the programming assignments are good practice. I qualify this in stating that I have not yet completed the next two courses on PGMs; this course may present an essential foundation that is necessary for the upcoming courses, and in any case provoked my interest in learning more about them",3
83085,"This course could have been better in my opinion, if we could have exercise that would deal with the concepts in more detail. I felt myself involved deeply in understanding the problem statement, rather than practicing the concepts explained in the course.",3
83087,"Online video is OK. But assignments are not much related to parallel programming specific issues. One case, this is my opinion but it's nice if students learn how scala solves ""The dining philosophers"" issue.",3
83090,Wrongly assumes that it'll be easier for students to jump from the conventional 'parallel' java paradigms and constructs to parallel streams.Not a good job on explaining why. It'll require from students some efforts to create the right picture in their minds.Exercises are great and partially make up for the above mentioned shortcomings.Some example code is very bad and goes against all the 'good' things being taught by Martin in the first course of the specialization.,3
83102,"In my view, this course was nowhere near as good as the earlier courses by Prof Odersky. The materials and pacing seemed all over the place - in some cases excessive time was spent going through quite trivial concepts, while elsewhere the course seemed quite rushed when looking at much more complicated ideas.",3
83107,"Content is good, less well polished than Odersky's courses though. Painful exercises with a lot of time spent on understanding the instructions instead of focusing on learning parallelism methods (especially the final assignment). Overall happy to have learnt from this, but clarity of assignments should be improved.",3
83114,"Interesting course, but far too short. It ends up giving a quick introduction to some of the aspects of parallel programming. I enjoyed the assignments, apart from last one where the difficulty was more about the context of the example than any parallel programming aspects. That example, extended, could be a good capstone project, but I think it was not appropriate as a course assignment. I prefer courses that follow a book, and this course didn't.",3
83126,"Deep lectures, but exercises where more about complex problems than about parallel programing",3
83139,Good course. But I have a strong feeling that would be nice to have more focus on the practice. Some lecture not really much with the results of assignments. Good course anyway. Pavel,3
83141,"The course if good, but i believe the content should be more didactic.",3
83157,should contain more details,3
83182,"Good learning materials, however the assignments are designed for compute science students rather than professional software developers as the most important part of the assignments is not parallel code, but it is algorithms. Yes, there is parallel code in the code of the assignments, but it is mostly written and your task is to implement the algorithm using this existing parallel code, while in my opinion it should be the other way around - you should implement parallel code and algorithms code should be already provided for you.",3
83204,Starting place to begin in continuing your horizons,3
83222,"The Course was fine. I would have rated it better if there were more practical examples, advice and real-life situations rather than so much theory.",3
83226,"Not a lot of interaction with other classmates. The material was a good refresher. Would have enjoyed more practical applications for homework. I thought there would be a bit more evidence based information as stated. Overall, good for newbies into management and a nice little refresher.",3
83243,A bit of repetition with module 1 of the Specialization.,3
83246,I feel content of the presentation need to improve. Second the voice quality also need some improvement it was not clear. It was looking as if some one behind the screen is just reading the slide content. Please elaborate each points mentioned in the slide. In some slides the end content was skipped.Better would be if some person is always present on the screen. It grabs the attention of the listener.,3
83255,"All in all,the idea of the topic is good and informative, however honestly speaking I didnt like teaching method of professors. The video volume was very quite.",3
83414,Not enough exercises. Better have at least 10 programming exercises for each week. More difficult material = more exercises.,3
83445,Needs to cover a bit more,3
83470,Access to assignments and grades should be given.,3
83508,"It may be the purpose of the course or the specialization, but I've been finding it too easy. I wish it could be more challenging and that it could offer me more opportunities do practice.",3
83699,too redundant,3
83823,It is a good course for beginners in Python language.,3
83965,"After also learning R from a non-Coursera MOOC, I find this Coursera course clunky and distractingly esoteric. Coursera occasionally crashes when attempting to parse or record the Python code that I've written, when that code runs fine on a regular IDE. This course in particular also includes lots of optional content that is either unnecessary (The Best Taco in the World video, for example) or for which it is unclear how to apply to Python (An interview with the inventor of JQuery, for example). Additionally, the instructor often assigns variable names that don't explain what the variable represents, which makes the videos a bit harder to follow than necessary. Despite all of this, I have learned a lot from this course.",3
83984,"I really love the way Dr Chuck is teaching. It is incredibly clear and you never get bored even if each lecture is over 20 minutes long. After each lecture you do feel like you've become an expert in that topic.However, the course is very diluted.... Only 4-5 lectures over 7 weeks is too little content, especially if you are to pay the $79 required for certification. Each week contains a lot of videos that, although being interesting, are not directly relevant to the course. I finished the whole thing in 2 days ^^",3
84028,"to simple, not sure enough practice to be good at python",3
84055,"Explanations is pretty well, but it is not so difficulty. So it's good for beginners.",3
84079,The assignments were easy at the beginning but hard at the end.,3
84198,Way too expensive for its contents,3
84262,Nice job ! However some of the important points have been skipped and focus has been limited at times.The best part of the course were the lab assignments.Hope quizzes were better in standard.,3
84304,Too easy.,3
84369,to easy,3
84402,"simple and easy for Python beginners, the instructor also has a textbook that could be good instruction.",3
84409,"Assignments are very easy, and there aren't easy to follow notes that one can use instead of always having to watch the videos.",3
84445,Somewhat dissapointed that only the built in Datastructures were discussed and done so with too much time.,3
84572,Fair course. Severance is a good lecturer but necessary to read all notes and the book chapter in addition to the lecture in order to understand the principles. Learned a lot from the course.,3
84692,I think the course should include a little project.,3
84771,Nice course but be aware that this is at a very basic level!,3
84781,"Probably good for anyone coming from a non-programmer background.If you're a programmer, can learn everything in a few hours just by looking at any Python tutorial.",3
84801,"The book really gave more details about the individual chapters. Hence it was easy to do the assignments and quizzes without watching the videos.I recommend that specializations should follow this trend, so students who find it difficult to access Internet can use the book as a guide.More examples are needed to understand the concepts especially Tuples and DIctionary",3
84854,"Hello,The course has been designed in a way which can help a person who doesn't even know Programming. I do appreciate that!But, just one question that I have is, why the deadlines for the Assignments are designed in such a way that Week1 of Introduction Course, and the Advanced (Object Oriented Programming) have the same deadline?",3
84865,"well, it's the previous part of the Python for everyone. Why did Coursera split it to another course?",3
84869,Good to build python basic data the concept clear,3
84936,"It's better than the first course of the series, but there is room for some more difficult assignments.",3
84966,Decent course. Could be put together a lot nicer.,3
84995,"Interesting, but the assignments were a bit dull. Learned a bit more about python.",3
85044,It's a good course to learn about data structures for beginers.,3
85118,"a little bit easy, I guess this course is for the beginners.",3
85272,More content can be put in.,3
85276,Not enough repetition in the way of homework. Expected a more rigorous course.,3
85300,Interesting and enjoyable; but I was looking for more of a rigorous introduction to Plato. The professor goes to a great deal of effort to make what otherwise might be a dry material engaging; but I sometimes felt like I was watching one of those science programs for children where they sell how great science with fun graphics.,3
85301,"The professor's view of Plato is unique and interesting. I would not recommend this as a first look at the Dialogues, however. Also, it was difficult to see how the lectures connected to the remit of the course, to teach ""reason and persuasion"", in Plato's view. The course was more of a ""modern take on ancient questions"".",3
85335,"no discussion forum and verified certificate, hence the 3 stars only. Prof Adelstein's analogies and video lectures are amazing otherwise",3
85504,I would have liked better tools to do this type of work.,3
85525,"Very simple, complete and usefulthanks",3
85547,The answer choices for the quiz are so obvious and can be easily guessed. It can be improved to make the student really think. Also the final quiz is just a repetition of questions we see in the module quiz. It can be different to test the effectiveness of the student.,3
85564,Thanks!,3
85584,"The language style used in the course makes it a little hard to follow, and I was a bit disappointed with how the whole class was left alone. Some of the materials mentioned in the course were hard or impossible to find. Some of the assignments didn't have a place to submit anything. Also the title of the course looks incorrect "" the Humankind's"". Despite all of that, I've learned some valuable information. Thank you.",3
85594,"I found the pronunciation of the Italian lecturers very difficult to understand at times and I am English, if I hadn't had the transcript I wouldn't have been able to complete this course to the level I like to perform at. Even those had some very unusual sentence constructions! Some of the questions in the quizzes were very badly worded and I had to guess the answers.",3
85598,"Fascinating knowledge delivered by instructors whose first language is definitely not English and who make it difficult to learn by their bad grammar, pronunciation and overall monotonous tone of speaking. However, the knowledge gained in this course is fascinating and I am thankful to the instructors for attempting to instruct more people in regard to this field and the details of it.",3
85600,Above the average score,3
85601,"Hello, as previous ones, this cousrse gives you basic understanding of the field and provide you with some additional materials for learning. It depends on you, whatever you study or don't. Speaking about me I would like to say thanks to the lecturer , althought the I'm not very interesting in any kind of research , thank you for your time and videos. Will review it once again to renew some ideas.",3
85646,"Standart indutrie DAW, but not my favorite. Good performance from the teach! I had many issue with pro Tools first, be sure to get a full vertion and an iLok key from avid before enrolling, will save much stress and trouble.",3
85655,"The course may be called Pro Tools Basics but this requires also basic audio knowledge. It shouldn't be explaining about microphones and how to connect an XLR cable.Also it was more a course on how to compose electronic music on Pro Tools rather than using Pro Tools for recording and editing. I mean not so many people use Pro Tools for composing. Pro Tools is a global standard for recording, editing, mixing and mastering. I was waiting to learn more things on these topics and not on EDM...P.S.I really like EDM but this shouldn't be the main focus of the course!",3
85689,good course,3
85711,The class and the content is very good! But the way that the professor teachs is kind of boring for me.,3
85717,Very basic. The structure is odd; the last week contains more material than the rest of the course put together.,3
85724,"It is good, very basic course giving the overview of the most important subjects in project management. Good as a starting point.",3
85733,Informative. Good introduction to basics in Project Management. Might have been helpful to have more case studies.,3
85735,Very easy to understand!,3
85736,I would have like it if they could provide free graded assessment to non-certificate students; and make option for certification,3
85750,"Not bad, the professor is very comunicative but I expected a bit more of contents",3
85752,Good content but the communication is not so great.,3
85764,The teacher could be more enthusiastic because sometimes it turned boring.,3
85805,"The content was well explained but a bit ""light"".",3
85810,Overview with key terminology and process information. Good introduction and/or refresher.,3
85818,"The information is quite useful, but they are not provided in an organised way. Sometimes, I got confused because of overlapping materials. However, in general, it's a good course to have an overview and some useful tools of project management.",3
85819,"Pretty Simple stuff - but would've been better if there was actually something we worked on in a group, or an actual project to 'plan' or gantt chart to create.",3
85834,It's a good course. It is very simple. It's just exposition and quizzes. Great for beginners.,3
85836,Great level of detail and information.,3
85849,Speak too fast and lack of interaction in the first 3 modules.,3
85857,No enthusiasm to hold attention but good content,3
85869,Good effort from Prof Stone in providing as much real-life relevance to the course.,3
85925,"I learned more about project management from a different course, which was about the Business of Games.",3
85955,"It has a good level, but there is room for improvement. Keep on the good work! Thanks!",3
85967,In my opinion a clear guideline is missing. The terms are not always the same and it's sometimes confusing.,3
85972,"Thank you for the lecturer, Rob, to prepare that great course on coursera platform for us to learn those knowledge in effective way. Thank you very much again.",3
85973,Very basic course that provides basic background information on project management.,3
85979,Very little course but gives you a base to understand how project management works,3
85986,Missed Agile Framework and other emerging techniques.,3
86008,Course was informative and a useful refresher but could have done with more worked examples in the tracking area specifically around value.,3
86010,"Good, but very very basic",3
86012,"Nice approach, needed more organized content!",3
86015,It is very high level course which will just cover bullet points. Details and elaborated explanation would have been excellent.,3
86038,Too basic.,3
86041,"The course had many information provided and thanks for that. But there are some things I disliked and I guess by fixing them the course would become much much better.1. The information refers to the PMBOK very often. That is good, as the PMBOK worth (must?) reading for any PM, but it is a bit difficult to understand anything while a teacher just retranslates something, from any book — especially not written by the one — with poor examples. The much better way for lecturer is to explain it by oneself, not by just staying there and repeating what I can read from my display.2. I dislike fixating to any software. Maybe Microsoft Project is a good example, but I am sure not the only one at first, and as I am a Mac person who has personal Macbook and Mac Pro at work I am not going to use Windows only for one application. There are plenty of them these days, the same or just similar. The key is not a software itself but the methodology using in the one. The methodology is worth understanding, for sure.3. Grammar mistakes and misprints. It looks a little strange that no one reviewed the materials: neither on Coursera (I am sure it is not so easy to review every course) nor the creators. I am highly puzzled about how it could be possible: if it is a free course for someone there are also many of those who are paying for the courses, and the courses also represent the University. How the University cannot find someone to check the mistakes before publications? (To be precise there are tiny mistakes related to headers and graphics which make the materials looks untidy).4. Materials production is very poor in details, even for the key ones: typography, colours, thickness of the fonts and lines. There are no contrasts, no highlighting — that looks as a draft, not as a final course worth spending the time, effort and money. If there are no people available to help with producing the materials of a good quality you can ask people from trueowl inc. (the website is trueowl.com and the working email is trueowl@trueowl.com) to help with it. They — we, as I am member of the team — are highly concerned about educational materials and motivated to enhance the quality of the materials, even for free of charge.Anyway I am glad I finished this course, as it gave me understanding which way should I continue with diving deeper into the theme.Thank you!",3
86059,really basic info,3
86076,"Information was good, a bit dry at points and the presenter didn't seem that enthused to be presenting. Overall decent course on an important and relevant topic.",3
86082,"Too basic, not enough coverage of topics discussed.",3
86083,Important basics for people starting their Project Management endeavour.,3
86085,useful for basics only,3
86096,The course is too short. It seems that many materials are removed.,3
86117,A simple vision of project management principles,3
86118,"Needs to be a bit more complex and detailed in order to help people get a good understanding of the complexities and issues involved in project management. Please use real world PM uses, not going to work..Show examples of project management that went horribly wrong..lots of those examples as well.",3
86124,"Prof Rob Stone is a very good speaker and has made the videos very informative.The content is very small, which is good because it makes the course very lean, but bad because it merely scratches the surface of project management world.",3
86132,"the course is relatively short for providing sufficient technology and knowledge to master a new project. It does give an overall concept of project management procedures and skills. Anyway, it is not as valuable as I expected from the beginning. The professor himself is of deep knowledge and proficient experience. I have experienced several projects and find this course not that well match my expectation.",3
86142,Clear and easy concepts for project management. I missed some practical exercice to put in practice the knowledge acquired.,3
86157,"Well structured and informative. Needs more in depth treatment of each section, additional materials( additional suggested reading would be nice), and more excitement from the professor. Thank",3
86162,"Very basic, very clear.",3
86166,Several mistakes on the translations of the exams,3
86204,useful informations but not very helpful for practical situations.,3
86212,"A decent course, perhaps not as interesting as the previous one. But definitely very innovative and informative",3
86223,"Good allround course with both theoretical and practical parts, because you now can buy a rather expansive certificate from taking the course the quizes are no longer available which is a shame.",3
86265,"It is quite interesting, but overall not very content heavy. It is a bit too much workshop style and lacking a bit the academic structure and content.",3
86283,Wonderful arrangment for learning.,3
86294,The content drags and can be boring,3
86348,"I love that topic, but I think, the videos are too monotonous. Maybe give it more pop-up quiz to make it better",3
86349,"Course material is a bit light, missing useful pieces of information. The example code is functional but not of sufficient standard to pass the documentation exercise. The solutions to the exercise are not covered in the course material. It takes a lot of outside work to get a good mark. Course is good, but the material needs a bit of work.",3
86373,"Seemed rushed, concepts not explained fully. videos are too formal, professor not funny and less relaxed than during the first two modules of this specialization",3
86388,I do not think some quiz questions are covered in the lectures.,3
86432,There should be more programing exercises.,3
86499,Somehow this section is bit confusing or rather to say the content is not really enough to work alone. Not even to solve the assignments without example codes.,3
86515,"Another good course in the Python Specialisation! You'll need to have a thorough grounding in dictionaries and lists for this module, so make sure you're across the concepts and syntax of those data structures :)",3
86573,"It was more difficult then previous course. As for me, it will be better to have more detailed explanation, because I think it was very fluent. Thank you!",3
86626,"toughest of all , very tough",3
86630,I learned a few new things on this course. It's not so much about the Python language as about the things you can do with it on-line,3
86686,Pretty good intro into accessing web data. Should be updated to use python 3 in my opinion since this is for new python users. Most of the course is useless to me because python 2 and python 3 are very different with beautiful soup and this and that.,3
86687,"Nice course, with very introductory information.",3
86757,a little bit too easy for person who had basic knowledgement of python,3
86802,This is a nice slow introduction to python web programming for those who have no experience or prior knowledge. Otherwise it is not at all challenging.,3
86829,not as clear as the previous courses,3
86832,its a good course .However i found it difficult since it requires you to understand how the internet and internet application work,3
86851,The course was not that clear should have taught more in detail thank you,3
86883,"It's too easy. I'd have enjoyed more challenching exercises about RESTful APIs, we have not seen any HTTP mehotd a part of GET and that's a shame.",3
86889,The course did give me the the theoretical and syntactical basics in terms of how web programming is done using python. Chuck Severance is brilliant in his ability to explain complex concepts by reasoning via analogy. It would have helped if the problem sets were more challenging and in tune with real world applications.,3
86931,Not clear examples in the videos. Tests are way different than what the Prof. covers in the videos.,3
86957,"too basic,you need read more online resources to do real projects.",3
86981,There are many details don't explain clearly enough for a beginner to understand.,3
87010,it's hard to understand,3
87115,"The course was a bit too shallow for me, the techniques shown are very basic examples of what can be learnt using stock python libraries (json, socket, urllib, ElementTree) or external (BeautifulSoup).I really expected something more, for instance authentication techniques, or methods to parse complex websites, rather or in addition to the basics shown here.",3
87160,more content is needed.,3
87161,"Maybe it's great for beginner, but the assignment is too easy .",3
87179,"Assignments are very easy, and there aren't easy to follow notes that one can use instead of always having to watch the videos.",3
87196,"All in all, I liked the class. I would like to learn about this topic and the database access using Python, and I still think this is a very good beginning. I like the enthusiasm of the instructor, but I think he short sells many of the things he is teaching. I would also suggest providing more challenging assignments, for instance, as optional ones. These may be such that they require reading the referred text in addition to watching the videos.",3
87204,This course is good for those people who has never program in Python. But for experience people there is nothing new in this course.I would really appreciate if1) the target audience is mentioned in a course it would be really helpful2) what a person would achieve after completion of a course .,3
87227,"Nice but quite simple. And I missed the teaching of good pythonic programming style (something that is more than just script step by step but encapsulate functionality in functions, use advanced programming techniques, test your code and so on).",3
87265,Its informative and easy for beginners,3
87298,Need to add more examples and contents for this class. Homework is so easy,3
87304,"It is good course, but I would like it to be in the more material and details of Python.",3
87333,"The course sped through the coding portions while spending a lot of time on the theoretical side of how the Internet works. Overall a very helpful overview, but I would have liked to spend more time coding.",3
87406,It was a fun but some of the assignments required deep thinking.,3
87531,Great ideas to improve the technical knowledges to scrapping web data,3
87534,The course is helpful.But there are not many practice exercises.It's quite easy.,3
87535,"More material, or coverage of the existing material with more library coverage would have improved the course.",3
87537,"Good course, but I might have used a little more rigor and material, maybe more exercises would have been nice.",3
87562,Assignment Doings felt not that good as the courses before.,3
87679,very very basic course looking forward to advance version of it.,3
87688,Wey easy for the person with some python experience but the best part is that takes only hours to complete all assignments and quizes,3
87759,"Course had pretty good basic information for people not familiar with programming. I would like to have seen more in-depth tasks or project(s) that would require deeper exercise of the topics covered in class. Each assignment boiled down to parsing a file using specific method (reg ex, Beautiful Soup, XML, or json libraries) to do the same task. Requiring people for instance to build additional data types already taught (lists, dictionaries) would have been at least little more challenging.Overall it is a good basic intro class.",3
87777,Great course but need to be updated to Python 3.x rules,3
87786,"Lectures were entertaining, but the assignments were way too easy.",3
87787,The material covered is more complex than the previous courses yet there is much less explanation given. It's still perfectly doable but one ends up feeling like you are missing something.,3
87808,Too much unnecessary videos. Content of lectures is poor. Tests are too easy.,3
87816,"The material is well explained, but there is not much of it... It is very very basic... The tasks, being extremely easy, don't really bring you further in understanding either.",3
87882,Course is good but the assignment are too basic. I would appreciate if there could be tougher assignments may be not included in rating.,3
87952,"This course is beyond abundant in great information. However, there is almost too much information to take in , and absolutely too much information to be able to study in just and hour a day. It needs to be stretched out into 6 weeks instead of 4 to accommodate those with an already busy schedule. For example, one 8 minute video might require an allotment of one hour to properly glean all the provided information. You will need to take notes on almost every word spoken so the pattern will be hit play, pause write out the last couple of sentences (the instructor speaks very quickly), hit play , pause and repeat until the end of the video and then re-watch it in order to absorb everything as one.And beware, in the peer reviews you will need to bullet and highlight EVERY point required extremely specifically in order to get full credit. For example, for the first essay, I wrote it out in ESSAY form as was specified and had all of the required points written out exactly how it was instructed. However, because I did not put into a basic outline form, I received a failed score. I resubmitted the EXACT same content in bullet-ed and highlighted form (which was NOT what was assigned) and miraculously received 100%.",3
87956,"Good course, good introduction to Public Relations!!!",3
87957,"A good intro to PR , but course material seemed somewhat redundant and lacked challenge at times. Professor's enthusiasm and passion was contagious and greatly appreciated.",3
87968,I thought it was going to be an all online digital strategy for pr. It's Ok though. the information is very useful.,3
88027,A lot of info cramped in long videos makes it confusing sometimes,3
88062,"most of the contents can be found on the website of raspberry, a quick start for those interested~",3
88086,Expected more based on the arduino course. Very lite on material,3
88087,"While it is a good class, I have a message that one of my assignments is passed by not verified. I have no instructions on how to ""verify"" it. I'm disappointed something that should be simple is such a roadblock.",3
88093,"A very good introductory course. The teacher is excellent as are the video lectures.Unfortunately, the new Coursera rules requiring payment before assessments can be accessed meant that I didn't complete any of the assessments. That will probably be a major disincentive for many learners who want to confirm what they have learned.Also, UCI have elected to disable the discussion forums for this course (although I found they could still be accessed via the Coursera App on my Android phone). I can't help wondering if this was as a result of some of the negative feedback posted on the forums in the earlier courses of this specialisation. If so, this really doesn't reflect well on UCI as a teaching institution!",3
88102,Is very basic and don't send assignments becose I don't pay the course.,3
88107,Too easy.,3
88116,"not actually much useful course, but still provide some interesting information",3
88118,Content is very basic.,3
88126,Not the best one on coursera. Included many details that are not really relevant and quizes just checked if you memorized it.,3
88142,New technologies are not explained in detail in a layperson's term.,3
88159,"Too basic, if you're not completely unfamiliar to the subject.",3
88170,"very shalow information, I would like if this course had a contination.",3
88178,Would have been more interesting if the slides had attractive colours and videos had good animations.,3
88181,Lot of emphasis on remembering things rather than understanding how they work.,3
88188,Description could be little more elaborate.,3
88192,Theory is too much.....,3
88204,"Good course, but too much data for the modules to fully grasp without a background.",3
88207,Very informative.,3
88208,Very common RF knowledge and less deeper knowledge than expected. It's an high level introduction but definitely no specialisation.Only the LTE part is much better and in more detail right now.Btw. I don't like presentations with reading only the visible content. We all can read by our self. More spoken details between the lines would be nice.,3
88230,Several times I uploaded material,3
88246,Grading rubric is too generic: If peers don't leave feedback then the student is left to draw assumptions from loosely-defined parameters.,3
88260,Capstone project methodology is a bit disappointing.The previous modules were great,3
88263,"It would probably make more sense if it was titled ""Project Management Capstone Project"" or ""Project Management Capstone"" or similar. Other than that, no complaints, a single peer assessed project to put into practice what you have learned in the other modules of the specialisation.",3
88301,"I enjoyed this course very much. Thank you for offering this course for folks like me who need an introduction to Project Management. Although it was extremely helpful to put my learning into practice and do the work, I found the peer reviews difficult to assess. When reviewing the work of my peers, some of the information did not flow as a project as a whole. For instance, sometimes the WBS did not match with the project activities sequence, but because the rubric/peer review was so broad, as long as the peer put down 10 or more activities, he/she received a perfect score. I do not believe this is an accurate reflection of ones full understanding of project management with the given rubric. I suggest creating a more detailed rubric that helps bring all the information together where those doing the peer review and those creating the documents can see the value of each part of the assignment. The assignment should essentially match the rubric to ensure accuracy of grading.Thank you again for this opportunity to take your course!",3
88332,"This course is very instructive and well-paced like the others in the specialization. However the Raspberry PI ecosystem has evolved since the course materials were created. Although it's still possible to follow the videos, I think it would make it easier to update some things a little bit.",3
88343,"Well course teaches basics of python but you should always refer to python documentation in order to understand the concepts correctly. To the course staff, please update the slides where Python2 is used to python3.",3
88364,"Very short overview, well explained but wish there was more depth.",3
88373,"It is indeed a good course, especially because of learning about UNIX and the GPIO pins. I missed reading material, since the videos are too short for learning something in a deep way.",3
88378,"good introduction to raspeberry but very few about python programming, expected more",3
88380,"Professor Harris does a good job overall, but he does not explain Python syntax in depth. I audited the course and found it quite simple. However, I recommend a paid subscription to get the most out of it.",3
88393,The course provides the right platform to folks who are newbie to python and gives meaningful information for development on Raspberry Pi,3
88398,A little light on content. Expected more interaction with features of the board.,3
88409,It is very good explained but it is just an small introduction about how to use the Raspberry Pi in a IoT framework.,3
88410,Content was far too basic in my opinion.,3
88414,"Mr. Harris is great! A lot of course content could be as a prerequisite. For example, basic control structures of the python could been left out, just having a reference to material describing them. I hope following course will focus more on Raspberry Pi specifics.",3
88421,More matter should be covered in this course.,3
88423,It is too simple and baic,3
88426,"This course would have received five stars but there was no discussion forum and the weekly assignments lacked clear explanation. I feel that instructor could have gone a little deeper into the subject matter.However, I liked the laid back instruction style. The assignments were perfect for beginners like me. I'm looking forward to the follow-up course.",3
88432,"Very well done (3 stars so I know I have completed the lectures but not the work, will change after completing assignments)",3
88447,"I found the course good overall, but the tempo was a bit slow for me and I thought that the online lectures could have been provided in a shorter period of time. Ideal for a beginner, but I had some previous experience with PFA.",3
88653,"I'd rather have assignments for which you really need to change/write code, not just run existing one. Otherwise the course by itself is great.",3
88661,"Not good enough. Only run, run, run, and less participation than courses before. Add some wrong code to correct may be better",3
88670,I thought this was a good course. Dr. Chuck goes through an interesting example of going through email data and there is plenty of time to do your own project.,3
88675,It is a very light course!,3
88683,"Not as much practical as the other Python courses provided in this series. The coding assignment is quite easy, since the code has been already written, the ONLY thing you have to do is RUN IT...",3
88684,I expected some more coding in the capstone rather than just apply code that has already been written,3
88694,Could have been more hands on.,3
88697,"Nice course, yet more hands on work was expected.",3
88703,"The Capstone was adequate, but I had hope for a bit more of a challenge. The specialization all together helped me get a better grip on Python Basics.",3
88724,"You are not actually writing any code for this particular course. The assignments are just taking screenshots of running code that is already provided to you in the code repository for this course. The lectures are great, there is a lot to learn from them but the assignments are a total bust. Not worth it for the money, but go for it if you want to complete the entire specialization",3
88726,"Capstone was great, although I would have learnt stuff better if there was a small battle from the deadlines and the curriculum in particular. This was a fun specialization and am looking forward to graduate soon! Thanks Dr. Chuck :)Cheers!",3
88727,"I really didn't learn much. Too much code, too complex, too fast.",3
88734,"I am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding, but there wasn't any. In any case, thanks Dr Chuck! :-)",3
88793,There were a number of different instructors and it was great to have a taste of varying topics from them.,3
88808,Too complicated for those who are new to philosophy. The basic concepts not very clearly explained. It seems that teachers had the assumption that students already had some previous knowledge of philosophy.,3
88813,Good food for thought,3
88814,This course teach you how important is to have philosophical mind.The overview of what philosophy is in the first lecture is awesome. In further lectures they go into tools of philosophy and major questions and arguments for them.But you have to read the hand outs and have to work yourself through the course.,3
88885,"Some brilliant videos, but some leave much to be desired. Nice introduction but don't get too hung up on it.",3
88889,"A good course. However, I would expect more coherence between the different modules discussed. In its current structure, the course represents a glance at an arbitrary selection of several topics (unrelated to e, existing in today's philosophy, rather than a coherent introduction into the broad discipline of philosophy. However, this may be just a matter of approach - this approach is also perfectly valid.",3
88896,"An interesting overview, but I wish it had been a bit more rigorous.",3
88912,"I almost gave this two stars, but the content of the course is excellent, and I didn't want to take away from that. To start off, for an introductory class, this covers a large amount and variety of material. It might be better served to break it up into even smaller sections over the course of something like ten weeks or even twelve instead of cramming it all into seven weeks.The lectures are enjoyable, but often they consist of nothing but the professor speaking. There are so many new terms, definitions, and ideas being introduced that it would help if these lectures also included slides or graphs with some of these ideas being broken down, as you would have in a regular class on a projector or on a chalkboard.Frequently, the practice quizzes are just the same questions from the video lectures repeated over again, and offer very little prep for the actual quizzes, which are painfully pedantic for a non-credit course. Every section has a different style of quiz, which is hard to prepare for. I am someone who usually tests well and have been struggling with most of these, even when I read all of the handouts and take notes.So, if this same course could be broken up over a slightly longer time and the quizzes could be more uniform, the lectures contained some slides, the course would be a brilliant introduction to philosophy overall. It's got all of the meat there, the presentation just makes it tough to digest.",3
88915,The course was interesting but overall very wide and didn't make a clear point.,3
88933,"I have a mixed feeling about it. Sometimes I felt, this course was trying to deliver more content in short time.",3
88953,"The classes were pretty good, but the bibliography was not. The bibliography consists of encyclopedia's articles which are not necessarily written to a beginner. It is quite discouraging for someone starting with philosophy to read articles which lacks a pedagogic approach.",3
88985,Good to follow by the subs,3
89047,The course does not have much videos and some of the lecturers (especailly week 5) talk TOO FAST. The subject is abstract and hard enough and talking too fast makes it harder.,3
89048,"The course is interesting and its staff makes a great team, but I think as an introduction course, it should focus on the History of Philosophy, without entering into very specific fields of Modern Philosophy. The fundamental notions of Philosophy should be available for learners, as well as the great Philosophers from Ancient Greece to the Twentieth Century.",3
89071,I found the course a little hard to follow mainly because the video lectures would not load. I found I spent more time trying to get the course material working than actually absorbing it.I really liked the lectures once they were working though. Its a very nice introduction to a way of thinking and the examples used to argument the theories were very entertaining.,3
89077,The course content is very superficial. The pass mark is very high for a course I had taken because of a mild interest. You have to get 80% to pass. One unit in particular was very confusing. It took me 7 attempts to pass it as I had no idea what the first question was about and there was no guidance as to what I was doing wrong.,3
89080,The way of presenting topics of philosophy is refreshing and inviting for further reflection. The tests however are focusing on nitty gritty differences or features in the presented videos. Less motivating to submit the tests and invites me to focus only on the preseed video and excellent links to other extra sources.,3
89097,"Well. It really covers the basic and foundation of Philosophy. I myself, love quotes about life and all. As such, when it comes deep down to these, I didn't really enjoyed the course as much as I thought I'd. Nevertheless, this is a decent introductory course if you are looking to know a slice of Philosophy. Do take note that a lot of reference with regards to the past philosophers are introduced as well. You are basically fed with all their beliefs. But do take them as a pinch of salt. What matters the most are your thoughts and views. Keep them open!",3
89102,"It is a very entertaining broad introduction to the topic of philosophy in general. The lecturers are very knowledgeable and are very good teachers. However, I wish there would be a more detailed treatment of the topics in question. I look forward to their future course on Philosophy of Science, as I believe that by focusing on a more narrow topic, they will be able to go a bit more in depth.",3
89115,"The course is interesting, the professors are good, they know how and what they have to explain. But the exercises and tests are really easy and do not require lots of knowledge. In fact, seems more like an explanation than a test. So, if you don't practice by yourself you won't learn a thing. Even though Coursera give you an certificate.I would add more and better practical exercises to make this course better.",3
89160,"If you do not know Bootstrap, JQuery, javascript .... you will get lost after two weeks and from the feedback, it can be clear seen.The course needs to be re-structured.",3
89179,"I enjoyed this course, but I was lost by the end. I understood the concepts presented in the videos (and got a high grade in the end), but the JavaScript needed for the last assignment was way over my head. I wish there had been more practice with actually using JavaScript; as it is I think I'll need to take another course or do independent study to learn what I should have learned to complete the last assignment.",3
89201,"Nice but lacking. Would like it to cover more content, specially around handlebars.",3
89202,The professors need to go into more detail with JavaScript. Our assignment required the use of JavaScript but it didn't fully explain how to use the code that was shared during our class. I enjoyed the class very much and I loved the challenge of figuring out how to complete the assignments. The best part of the assignments consisted of being able to view classmates submissions and learn from them by reviewing the code techniques that they used.,3
89206,Quite easy but I learned a few things.,3
89207,thanks guys.,3
89215,The course is useful. I've learned many things but in the last week the lectures seemed very rushed. There was many coding that was poorly explained or not explained at all. It started good but ended poorly.,3
89225,Information provided are good. All in this course is about theoretic knowledge. One who completes the course has to remember each points when designing a website and also implementing. Further improvements required in this course to make sure more knowledge when taking this course.,3
89232,"I did learn some new things, but there were times that I wasn't sure about the focus of the course:some of the questions are on the spectrum of too tricky-unclear, there were too many ""find my error in the code"" issues.Plus, the last project (gallery) - which has many good features and ideas, does not seem completely finished from a UX point of view.",3
89266,It was a bit hard to follow the instructions.,3
89317,"I was a little confused because for having a focus on ""Science and Philosophy"", it seemed to me to mostly talk about science and religion through a philosophical lens. The last module was very scattered and hard to follow. Other than that, very interesting, well-presented material.",3
89319,"Week 1 of the course seemed very interesting. A lot of interesting questions were raised - enough to lead me to view the course in a rather positive light. As I progressed through the course however, I noticed that some rather contentious claims were made to seem to have more credibility than they in fact do. Take for example something that was said in week 4, lesson 3. It was insinuated that Lamarckism plays a significant role in evolutionary biology, something that is widely questioned by eminent specialists in evolutionary biology (for ex. Jerry Coyne).Furthermore, it sometimes seemed that rather than presenting the facts for the learners to judge, the lecturers were presenting their own views (this was especially the case in week 4).This course is being funded by Templeton Foundation, an organization that promotes religious apologetics. It seems that rather than presenting facts as they are, the course is disseminating material deeply influenced by a religious agenda.",3
89330,"2 weeks were balanced and thought-provoking and one was silly, but entertaining... therefore three starts with 2 stars taken out for ending a good course with a week of silliness.",3
89340,"The course gives an general theoretical overview about nutrition, but not goes further into details or practical example.",3
89355,"good, but not enough ..",3
89383,Fairly good. Fundamental knowledge for researcher.,3
89428,"very good course, but I never recieved the feedback I needed on the forum",3
89443,mechanically it worked pretty well. just a little hard to figger out what's going on and what's important. what needs to be memorized and what just needs to be understood . . .,3
89497,"Just three stars so far, I've just started the course late... I think it looks good tho.",3
89515,interesting and informative course.,3
89516,"The actual educational value of this course is quite high. The score I can offer it in good faith is dragged down by the additional ""assignments"" like ""Write you own quiz question!"" and the expectation to review the quiz questions thought up by other students. Such things in a scientific course are unnecessary and may actually be counterproductive because of the reliance upon other students and their grasp of the material. If they are to remain part of this course, they really should be treated as supplementary and not required to complete the course. It really detracts from the experience for those of us who come here to learn and not to socialize.",3
89570,"I found the course interesting, however I had trouble finding all of the written materials to read. Some were available online, but none were in our library system. I think it would be better if more of the reading was available to people. I also thought that the final assignment instructions were a bit confusing. As it is I never did get to upload the photographs for the final prompt. I asked for help on the forum, but no one responded.",3
89574,i enjoyed the interviews -- hearing and seeing many different artists using the same medium in very different ways,3
89596,"Nice, but I expected more (or something else).",3
89633,"Teaches the history well, but doesn't focus much on helping to improve.",3
89635,"I would have, if possible, not rated this course. I was not interested in the work of the more recent photographers/photo manipulators. This is a course for the art crowd, not for those interested in the history of photography.",3
89641,It was short and interesting... and that is good. In the first week the readings were overwhelming and I was disappointed - but the other 5 weeks had short videos of interviews with photographers to go along with the concepts presented. Some of the quiz questions were looking for details that I felt were not important for the learner. Final assignment was good.,3
89642,"This Course is very interesting because it covers the work from iconic photographers since its invention in 1839 to these days. The ""but"" I found is : first, the required readings are very extensive, and second , the questions for the quizes are most of them too much specific, and there are so many photographers names that it is quite a challenge to have more than five questions right. Otherwise, it is a captivating MOOC, designed more for Photographers than lay public.",3
89754,"This was an informative class. As a ""newbie"" to the Coursera community, I wanted to take a course that would expand my knowledge of art and culture while fitting within my hectic work and family schedule. Photography is something I engage in almost daily with my iPhone, so I took a chance and was not disappointed. Sarah Meister has curated a wonderful assortment of photographer artists that typify the historical and aesthetic advances in photography. The articles, videos, and slideshows were well constructed around the theme of each module. The articles would benefit from including some of the images discussed. This was not a major problem as I was able to Google most of them. The videos were interesting and of sufficient length not to strain my attention. The slideshows were my favored documents due to the inclusion of images and explanatory text. I did find it frustrating that some of the answers to the quiz assignments could not be found in the required reading, videos, or slideshows. As an educator, I can certainly understand wanting students to think critically but some of the questions were misleading, unanswerable based on the content, or appeared unrelated. Many of the items did not assess my understanding of the information so much as how closely I read for specific quotes or other esoteric content. This is further evidenced by the posts in the forums requesting guidance about certain items. Overall, the course is worth the effort and time if you are interested in the history of photography and its most notable practitioners.",3
89781,"I really enjoyed listening to the lectures. The instructors are very knowledgeable and explain topics well. The assignments are in line with the course material. This course encouraged me to think critically about mental health, specifically major depression from a public health perspective. The reason why I gave it 3 stars is because I didn't find that there was much discussion on the discussion board. Each student just answered the question proposed by the instructor and that was it. There wasn't much discussion back and forth among the students. Also, I think the lectures are from 2013 so I am wondering if this course is being updated and covering the most current research in public health?",3
89784,"The second week, by Wietse Tol, is simply brilliant. I learned a lot about the etic and emic perspective on depression, and his insights about sociocultural factors are amazing. On the other hand, the last two weeks are boring and dull: they take the typical psychiatric bias and simply ignore any research compromising their orthodoxy (for example, Kirsch's studies). It would be interesting to include, as well, critiques to the concept of depression as well: there are transdiagnostic approaches expanding quite quickly, besides classical critiques of DSM categories. Overall, I would focus on the first three weeks and ignore the rest.",3
89806,"While Professor Kaul's enthusiasm and passion for finance is inspiring, his lectures are not entirely helpful come time to face assignments. He often rambles through the material, spending more time talking about his life rather than the material at hand. When he decides to finally talk about the material, it presented in a disorganized and confusing fashion. If he developed a disciplined schedule with material that was on par with the assignments, this course would not have been nearly as frustrating; challenging assignments, I agree, are crucial for learning the material well. I just wish I didn't have to spend more time browsing the internet finding material pertinent to answering his arbitrarily open-ended questions.",3
89813,Loving It!,3
89852,Good quick introduction. Very good. Easy to work through the Exercise Sets. Professor typing on he keyboard quite loud.,3
89880,As per Oxford Dictionary:concise / adjectivegiving a lot of information clearly and in a few words; brief but comprehensiveThis course: really brief; not that clear nor well-structured; not nearly comprehensive.Is it at all possible to be both brief and comprehensive when teaching programming?,3
89892,"Definitely a ""concise introduction"". I felt like the course was a little too easy and didn't provide much meat to the material. A good start for an inexperienced programmer, but too remedial for experienced programmers.",3
89913,"This course was pretty okay, I'd say. I did learn several new things and consider myself ""introduced"" to the world of python. Unfortunately, as a BRAND NEW programmer, it was, at times hard to keep up. There were a number of elements that weren't sufficiently explained during the lessons/assignments (presumably because we 'should' have a basic understanding of coding already...I guess?). If this is the case, some outside study/background research may be necessary, at times. The instructor was actually relatively helpful, though the forum format makes for lag in help time, meaning you could be stuck on a problem or with a question for a while (again...outside study/research required). Overall, as I said, I learned things- yay! This course is for the very patient, however, and may likely by too simplistic for those with programming experience, too difficult for those who have never coded or maybe just right for some lucky few.",3
89921,"A quick introduction, just what I was looking for.",3
89942,"a good course, especially as an introduction to Python 3biggest drawback: assignment autograding - if something fails, you do not know what fails, only that it fails (no info about test cases and results; negligible feedback from TAs)",3
89951,The assignments are not very relevant to what is being taught. Java 7 instead of Java 8 makes things too verbose. Lenskit is painful to use and in the week 4 Honors assignment its just impossible to get the results desired by the grader. I would suggest the Teaching team to use R/python scikit instead of Java,3
89952,"Generally I like the contents of this course. I particularly like that insights are provided in terms of what aspects to consider when designing a recommender system; pros and cons of different approaches. However I'm also extremely bored watching the videos because looking at the lectures reading the scripts (most of the time with very slow speed) is one of the quickest way to send people to sleep. I'd hope the lectures will improve their presenting skills.Another comment is the honours track assignments should really be put into more thoughts. I passed them with 100% credit, but I didn't feel I gained a lot useful knowledge through this exercise. Generally it felt to me that the complexity of the implementation is much much more than needed in relation to the complexity of the problems. Eventually this assignment became grinding with Java's verbose, annoying syntax and unnecessary computations designed in lab instruction. For example, in the first programming assignment, why if the ModelProvider object already computed the entire map of ratings, and the map is directly needed in the Recommender object, the Model object only provide API to retrieve individual rating but not the entire map?! Isn't it a wasteful computation to reconstruct the rating map? So I doubt the structural design of the program is sensible, or the expected solution would actually be done in real applications. Also I think Java is just a really out-dated, bulky language to work with in this kind of task. It really makes the assignment experience awful.",3
89953,"Pros:Some useful terminology if you want to ever communicate with someone who does recommender systems.Cons:Very diluted content.Mostly large text slides with the presenter talking in a monotone voice.Programming exercises are done in Java and require deploying an IDE + an unused open source project developed by the authors. Hint to the authors: use Python, R or Octave like everyone does.Some of the questionaries are ambiguous.",3
89957,"Ok, it's an introduction, but it could at least show us some math or pseudocodes. A part from that, the course is really awesome. Well structured classes, good explanations and incredible interviews",3
89960,"As an introductory course, the content was good. But I wish the approach was more analytical and more hands on. Rather than history of Recommender systems & what happened in the 90s, I would have been happier if the course was able to throw light on the latest stuff in this field, the latest mathematical techniques etc.",3
89962,"I expected a lot from this course but it could have been a lot better - lengthy videos, not trying to explain the concepts in an understandable ways. Ended up confusing with various interviews and what are differences between various content based recommenders. The programming exercises were good and provided a good overview.",3
89988,"I'd rather have assignments for which you really need to change/write code, not just run existing one. Otherwise the course by itself is great.",3
89996,"Not good enough. Only run, run, run, and less participation than courses before. Add some wrong code to correct may be better",3
90005,I thought this was a good course. Dr. Chuck goes through an interesting example of going through email data and there is plenty of time to do your own project.,3
90010,It is a very light course!,3
90018,"Not as much practical as the other Python courses provided in this series. The coding assignment is quite easy, since the code has been already written, the ONLY thing you have to do is RUN IT...",3
90019,I expected some more coding in the capstone rather than just apply code that has already been written,3
90029,Could have been more hands on.,3
90032,"Nice course, yet more hands on work was expected.",3
90038,"The Capstone was adequate, but I had hope for a bit more of a challenge. The specialization all together helped me get a better grip on Python Basics.",3
90059,"You are not actually writing any code for this particular course. The assignments are just taking screenshots of running code that is already provided to you in the code repository for this course. The lectures are great, there is a lot to learn from them but the assignments are a total bust. Not worth it for the money, but go for it if you want to complete the entire specialization",3
90061,"Capstone was great, although I would have learnt stuff better if there was a small battle from the deadlines and the curriculum in particular. This was a fun specialization and am looking forward to graduate soon! Thanks Dr. Chuck :)Cheers!",3
90062,"I really didn't learn much. Too much code, too complex, too fast.",3
90069,"I am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding, but there wasn't any. In any case, thanks Dr Chuck! :-)",3
90083,The assignments had a lot of ambiguity. The course content was wonderful. It would have been nice if 3d computation problems were involved. Week 4 was really interesting !,3
90096,can be much better with little bit of more explanations and more relevant resources for help,3
90106,"Not much content covered in course, especially compared to Aerial Robotics. No real great sense of achievement on completion.",3
90115,"The course is ok, it touches on some interesting topics and it serves its purpose as an introductory course. Unfortunately more interesting topics are only briefly mentioned at the end of the last video. I also think the assignments can be improved, some assignments lack documentation, one of them had a coordinate system swapped from what was shown on screen and the evaluation of some assignments are quite tight, even if you have it working, unless you deliver exactly as it is expected you will fail, not to mention what is expected is sometimes blurry.",3
90124,"Only for introduction, more materials shoulb be supplied.",3
90128,"Great course! but there was too little content!!!! Double it !! Or double the coursework! make us do more work! Also, tell people to use 'parfor' to speed up the computations.Otherwise, great course!",3
90129,"First course of this specialization was really GREAT, byt this course disappoints.Of course, there are some interesting topics, but the form of the course is way lazier. Videos are short, there is small amount of additional materials,",3
90133,Very good introduction course for motion planning. Could be better if there is more interactions with the TAs. Also the matlab assignments have some minor mistakes which takes time to figure it out.,3
90142,"Very interesting material, but also very light instruction. Requires some MATlab intuition.",3
90145,"The lectures were good, but many assignments had errors (graders, errors in code)",3
90149,The materials are not deep enough. And the programming assignments are just so-so.,3
90158,The first two assignments certainly tested knowledge of the subject however the last two assignmnets were lacking. Good course that does what it is supposed to do. More feedback from test cases would be very helpful.,3
90162,"Overall decent course.This course focused less on the theory aspects in the course videos, which bothered me a lot considering I am paying for it. But the explanations were still good for those algorithms.The assignments were good as well. I liked how they made us work on them instead of the first course where we were mostly tuning parameters. Hopefully MOOCs start having challenging assignments too.The instructor explained really well too!I didn't really end up visiting the Discussion Forums for this course at all. So can't comment on the participation from other students or TAs.Future Advice -Considering how other courses offer about 1-2 hours of course videos, I think this course could offer a lot more. One assignment problem focusing on one algorithm, while having other challenging algorithms taught in those videos to be left for our own implementation would help students a lot more i believe.",3
90165,"Most of the homework assignments aren't graded correctly out of the box and have errors. Also, only specific solutions are selected. Otherwise it's great material at a good pace.",3
90166,Great course but programming assignments in MATLAB had too many issues.,3
90168,"I think there is need to provide clearer instructions on how to get the programming assignments done. The course content is good, but doing the programming assignments needs to be more clarified.",3
90173,In comparison to the first course this one lacks a lot of organization and debugging before sending it to the public,3
90174,"The material is interesting, however there is not enough information provided by the course to effectively implement the algorithms in the allotted time of each week's assignments. It relies on deferring to external reading materials as primary sources, and these resources were not specified in advance to secure copies in a timely manner.Additionally, there is a big disconnect between the knowledge provided by the weekly material and what is required to easily do the programming assignments in the suggested time of 3 hours.Overall the course material needs to provide more background material to be more effective in delivering the knowledge expected each week. This may be an artifact of trying to cram what other online course provide in 7-10 weeks down into 4 weeks. If the intention is to give a ""flavor"" in 4 weeks, then the material needs to be distilled down into more of a cookbook format.",3
90177,"Although the course covers interesting subject areas, I feel like the various topics should have been explored to a greater depth. I understand that someone with lesser background in the relevant areas might not agree with me. But overall, I felt slightly underwhelmed by the course.Also, the skeleton of code provided for the assignments had minor errors and the instructions for assignments were sometimes ambiguous or even incorrect as compared to what was actually required of the code. But these minor issues will most likely get resolved in subsequent offerings of the course.",3
90186,"I think that the theory was very poor in sense of the videos were very short and with little content. The topics that we've seen were difficult to learn by itself, and a better explanation could be very useful in practice.",3
90188,"Feedback is useless, but content is fine.",3
90205,Not quite what I expected. More on the role of the interviewer than the actual design of questionnaires.,3
90234,There should be more than just lectures. I find the overall content to be very exciting but at times the lectures get a little boring and monotonous maybe.,3
90257,"There is a lot of self-teaching with these courses because there are no professors present to reach out to with questions. In addition, the course staff do not always respond promptly nor are they fully knowledgeable about all aspects of error messages that may arise out of coding. At times the code that were provided in the lecture videos were out of date and a lot of time was spent on googling to find the updated code. This is definitely not a beginner coder course and I do not recommend it to anyone who has not coded before.",3
90275,Too much theory and projects didn't related with real life problems.,3
90310,"I really loved the dense collection of relevant information, this course is a great introduction to computer vision-related algorithms.Unfortunately the lecture videos are poorly edited and subtitles are inaccurate, however the slides are quite good and verbose enough to understand every topic.Assignments are quite good, however formula derivation explanations could be better.",3
90311,"The course is a very good overall description of the Perception field. The part I really liked is that there was no haste or a concept just superficially discussed - lectures are long and detailed. The presentation of lectures especially from Prof. Jianbo Shi are excellent - to represent Matrices in colours and give a intuitive sense of every formula(especially the Jacobians and treating the image blending process as painting) .The bad part of this course is that pronunciations of faculties could be a little unclear and hence a very good transcript is required - which in this course is not upto the mark. There were few mistakes on the slides and should be rectified atleast in the pdf of the slides. What this means is that we have to go through some frustration while watching the video first time which gradually improves on second or third view. Also, there is absolutely no participation of teaching staff. A good content should be supplemented with assistance to further enhance learning experience. Few doubts because of this remains unclear and I wish I could have got this sorted in this class.",3
90315,"I dont like how this course was presented. The professors are good but the way how they present the course is extremely inefficient. I mean, because the instructor only speaks moving hands from one side to other, it was very difficult to visualize what and where the instructor was referencing to. Eg. a figure with 3 formulas and many variables there was no way to know in what alpha variable in formulas the instructor was talking about, once all formulas had the alpha variable. Also, when trying to describe a 3D environment only moving hands, its quite impossible to determine what and where the instructor is. One suggestion to try to minimize this problem would be try to use a lase pointer or a stick or a pen or something similar to help the student to now where the instructor exactly is. One example of good presentation is the course of ML from Andrew Ng where he writes all the things while speaking which facilitates the student to follow the sequence. Hope this can help.",3
90321,The videos are so long in time and not very clear.,3
90322,Lessons and videos are very long for one week.,3
90337,"Interesting topics, but not taught in the most interesting way. The professor answered in his lecture videos some of my basic questions about advertising, but I don't think that he made the class very exciting and I didn't feel motivated to seek out outside material. I'm glad I took this course, but I don't think that I would recommend it to many other people.",3
90355,"There was some nice content, but not practical enoough",3
90375,"Should include recent material. A reference book from 2001 is very out of date, especially in the software world.",3
90380,More assignments would help reinforce learning,3
90416,"I had difficultly with the two assignments, not because they were difficult but because the instructions were not clear. From reviewing other's assignments, it did not appear to be just me.",3
90417,Important topic to cover....Nice course,3
90458,This course has contents that are repeated multiple times throughout the course. I think entire course could have been covered in a week or at most two weeks.,3
90460,"Interesting material, but wasn't necessarily of the same depth of knowledge like previous courses in the series",3
90464,That's the best course of the entire specialisation.,3
90465,"Not a well structured course. Also, not very motivating to go through this one.",3
90486,"Has interesting ideas and approach to forming a structure way of analysing a problem. The module does feel a little thin in content, and perhaps should be combined with Exploratory Analysis.",3
90487,content is not enough for one class. should be only one to two videos.,3
90489,"Course content is okay - there was some repetition of topics throughout the weeks. As the other first courses in the specialization, students would benefit tremendously if the instructors were a bit more active - the course feels out of date and abandoned.",3
90493,Why is this its own class? Seems like it could have been covered in a week somewhere else.,3
90504,"Too expensive for the material it provides; it is helpful and necessary but this course can be summarised in 1-2 lectures. There is a very good lecture from an external speaker,which was very good and funny (at least i found it funny) and i didn't realise that it was 30 mins long.",3
90517,"The course was good. I enjoyed it. The biggest problem was the un-moderated participation of at least one other student. This particular student drove the discussion of assignments, leaving little room for others to explore, ask, and answer questions. As far as I know the student was not a mentor/TA, but It would have been most helpful for staff to weigh in on some of the student's post. I really believe the student was feeding his/her ego.",3
90518,"Course is generall very good and lots of fun!2 things i would change:... the Assignment 1 is too early in the course or the Lectures are disordered, but I needed the second and third week material to do the first weeks assignment.... Add Jupyter Notebooks in the Specialization in addition to Knit-R",3
90531,The content is good but the contents have a lot of overlap. The instructors are definitely knowledgeble about the material and clear about the presentation but a lot of the same matierial are repeated throughout the course unintentionally. Think the insturctors just thought it was enough to throw a bunch of things together and called it the day.,3
90539,"It's, for sure, a necessary content but don't feel like something that deserves to be on this specialization. Content is good.",3
90548,Week1 can be explained better. First assignment i was clueleass on Kintr and how to generate report.,3
90554,The first week assignment should really be the second week assignment since all the lessons about knitr would have made the assignment much easier.,3
90559,"To be honest, I couldn't realize why this had to be an entire seminar on its own. Apart from that, in some videos the audio quality was rather poor and the instructor seemed to have caught some cold or something. Although the topic of the course is interesting and significant, I think that do far it is the least engaging of the specialization...",3
90564,"Some of the videos has low quality, which make them harder to understand for non native speakers. In my opinion there is also too less tips for second assessment.",3
90568,"Overall a good course for self-study. The assignments in particular are excellent for data cleaning, analysis and interpretation. The quizzes are very basic though and appear to be there only to check if the student has gone through the lectures. The knowledge needed to answer the quizzes and achieve the desired results in the assignments are vastly different and should be addressed.The case studies at the end are insightful and more use could be made of them in a more advanced course. There is a lot of repetition of concepts throughout the course and this can become distracting. THe format for the lecture videos varies throughout and this inconsistency (along with extreme audio volume changes) also becomes distracting.Other than that, excellent for driving the need for reproducible research (RR) home, presenting and explaining some tools available to achieve RR and ways of publishing results/reports from these studies.",3
90578,"Some parts were very useful. Some parts looked useful, but when I tried it in practice, it was almost impossible to do for me. The course wants to make you behave like a machine, for a part of your job. So you have more room in your head to behave the way you want to. But behaving like a machine, I tried, but I can not. Still there are very usefull parts in this course. I did about 4/5 of the course.",3
90599,very minimal presentation of many concepts!,3
90603,Not deeply explained not for beginneer.,3
90609,need more lectures. there are complicated topics with weak background for the students.except that it is a great course. thanks..,3
90614,"This course is very useful and interesting, but the materials of week 2 & 4 is enough for their quizs.",3
90618,Course contents are very short and to the point. I thought weeks on Gaussian Model Learning and Robot Mapping were neat. But the other two weeks on Kalman filter and Particle Localization were little disappointing. They could have discussed both these topics properly by investing more time. Couple of Assignments are tough and there will be very little help to complete it but nevertheless it will keep you interested in the course.,3
90621,Poor structuring of assignments. Unclear objectives and wrong input data.Course Content was good.,3
90630,"Who teaching us is a student, and the assignment is not in detail as other class",3
90631,Really too short.,3
90640,"good course, but need to pay for tests",3
90649,Was expecting more videos than readings.,3
90657,"I have done the first 2 parts and I am half way through the 3rd and I am finding some of the information to be inaccurate. According to the NHS in the UK condom failure rate is 2%, not 15% as stated in this course. It also seems to put a bit too much emphasis on Abstinence. I would recommend every one taking this course to do some further research into contraception and find out more accurate information.",3
90659,The lectures should be longer and more detailed.,3
90662,Too easy,3
90664,The course is very helpful for those who have very limited time on their hand. I wish videos were longer since I prefer to listen more than to read. You need some background on the reproductive system in order to fully understand it.,3
90667,It's nice course but a little bit boring.,3
90687,Well I liked the course untile the last assignment. It says you need 3 hours for this assignment but I could finish it after two days (and I am good in programming). The last assignment is not really well designed specially the trajectory part. The rest of the course was good.,3
90695,"would of liked to see more programming examples in the lectures. But all in all, fun course!",3
90696,"This is a good course, and you get an overview of a lot of interesting topics. However, as you advance further in the course, some of the math begins to lose consistency, while some of it just gets skipped.",3
90703,"Very informative, but the coding elements can be somewhat difficult mainly because there's not many specific examples provided. It is still a very enlightening course. PS You definitely need to at the very least be very familiar with Differential Equations to take this.",3
90704,"I had problems with lots of small inconsistencies in notations...I prefer courses which are mathematically more precise, and develop the material more systematically.",3
90717,"The course is definitely has some value. At least it helps to feel the taste of quadrotor control. But there are some cons. 4 weeks is too short, and this entails fragmentation of course materials. A lot of reasonable questions are not answered and even not mentioned: we use Euler's angles, which lead to singularities and ambiguities, there are quaternions, but we'll not use it. Why? - no answer. PD gains tuning is manual. Is there any robust methods to build controls automatically? - no answer. And so on and so forth. And the last... lections are really boring, lector monotonically reads text, nevermind what - matrices, formulas, etc. He reads all of it in completely, with the same manner, without any interactivities with the slides. Actually it is realy demotivates. I guess one of students that made supplementary materials with marker will do much much better.Anyway, thanks for the course. I believe that highly motivated learner can get something new from it.",3
90730,"Not a beginner course. You need an engineering background to know how to interpret the equations enough to finish the coding assignments in Matlab. Some of the equations presented don't have enough explanation behind them for them to seem in context or to give any idea about how they can be applied.I have a background in electrical engineering, and I studied control systems in undergrad, so I was able to get by. If you can't manage through this course, don't feel like you aren't smart enough to complete it; rather, you just don't have the proper pre-requisites.",3
90743,Not for those with no background in advanced engineering math. Expect to pick up independently most of the things that are being taught.,3
90776,"The course provides a good insight into the world of Aerial Robotics and the dynamics involved in controlling the quad-rotors. Were the course fails is it does not explain the basics , there is more focus on trial and error and the questions are not formulated correctly such that they are simple to understand. It could have been better if the Introductory course to the specialization had little mathematical involved or could have been explained in simpler terms or with examples instead of showing the equation in the video.",3
90784,"The course covered very interesting topics, but it would have preferred more detailed explanation of PD controllers and especially how to choose the tuning constants.",3
90801,At the end I do not feel that I have learned something.,3
90822,Some topics were explained in a shallow manner. I suggest providing detailed lecture notes besides the videos for students trying to understand math and physics behind the concepts introduced in videos,3
90845,"I think there is need to provide clearer instructions on how to get the programming assignments done. The course content is good, but doing the programming assignments needs to be more clarified.",3
90851,"the course and the lessons are really interesting and the professor is explaining really well. Especially nice are all the videos demonstrating what have been done so far.Problem are the assignments:-all the assignments are about controlling a quadrotor, but a matlab code 95% done is already provided and most of the times the only thing requested is to spend days in find (randomly) the correct values for the controller gains;-the last assignment is again partly about (randomly) looking for gain values and partly about generating a trajectory as a piecewise 7th order polynomial, where the method for creating such thing is only mentioned in the assignment pdf and with wrong conditions. Even with the correct conditions, with a previous knowledge of numerical methods you can go through it, but otherwise it takes quite some time;-the grade is not set properly.. you either take 0points or the maximum, meaning that for just passing the assignment you have the same difficulty as getting full marks.. if you arrive (after days of trial and error) to the point of passing the assignment, then you can easily get full grade with small changes.. which makes no sense;-the explanatory pdf for the assignments or the provided codes some times contain errors, and I don't understand why they are not fixed considering that this course is already the second time that was provided;-the assignments are fully based on matlab and to actually understand something it is required quite a deep knowledge of how to use it.. I work daily with matlab and had some difficulties in following what it is done. If somebody is new to matlab, it will be quite difficult to do even the easier tasks;-the evaluation function for the last assignment is extremely slow.. it took me 40minutes to evaluate the results.. and considering the many iterations usually required for (randomly) finding the gains this really doesn't help.Summarising I am quite happy about this course and glad to have done it, but please fix the many problems in the assignments. I have taken many courses online in different platforms and this was so far the most time consuming one..",3
90856,"The course is interesting and entertaining at times, though seems relatively undercooked. Typos in video lectures and assignment writeups are still frequent. The course content is a bit rushed, with some rather difficult aspects left almost unexplained. Definitely not for begginers, as some knowledge of physics, differential equations, calculus, matlab programming is highly recommended!",3
90862,"Some good material and I good introduction to aerial robotics. But, it doesn't cover all the theory needed to actually write flight control software for a quad copter. If you are really new to robotics you will need to spend at least 40-50 hours a week ""discovering"" enough of the details to pass the course.",3
90877,"All in all the material, videos and assignments were very interesting and they made up an exciting course.However, some of the slides lacked sufficient information on notions or did not make references to supplementary sources. The assignment material (mainly pdfs) sometimes had typos which made solving them a bit confusing and more time consuming without actually being very difficult. Also for both slides and assignments the notations were not always consistent and/or variables disappeared from equations without clear explanations.I hope in the next offering of this course there will be improvements on these aspects.",3
90883,"I think there needs to be more association elaborated between the video lectures and the questions being asked during the lectures. It seems these questions are asked before the lecture itself tends to touch the point of it.Secondly, it was a bit difficult to associate the assignment write-ups to the lectures. Obviously they were relevant but this should be more clear in text and video.",3
90889,"the course is ok, but the assignment require a lot of prior knowledge on automation control theory, which can be really difficult to be done.I suggest that they should provide extra material for those students who have only computer science background.",3
90894,"Good ,but many complaints regarding PID tuning from students need to be addressed in the upcoming sessions",3
90895,"Overall good course that would definitely make you spend more time reading and learning on the side. Would recommend it those who have good background in college level math like Linear Algebra and a little bit of Robotics Background from a Math perspective - like working with translations, rotations, transformation matrices of that sort to make the transition easier. (There are basic robotic courses online to help with that, like Peter Corke's course). But overall this course requires some significant effort to explore the material from an external perspective.Some issues however -1. Lack of added resources like reading material to support the course and help advanced students go beyond the course themselves.2. Severe lack of activity from TA(s) on the forums. It's good that students get to interact among themselves and learn on their own, but every single post should be either answered by a TA to clarify doubts or they should acknowledge that another student's explanation was good enough to answer a particular question.3. The in-video quizzes weren't up-to-the-mark as per me. One question asked ""why"" and the answer was literally ""because that's how that algorithm is"".4. This is a trend in MOOCs and I don't think it can be helped, but perhaps more assignments that help understand the concepts better with examples would help students go beyond. If this course had such optional assignments that would be great for understanding the concepts with a more hands-on approach. But this is probably not the best platform to do so.Overall would recommend future iterations of this course, especially if the first two points above are improved upon.",3
90902,Please include supplementary materials on controller tuning.,3
90908,"This course was very good and very interesting. The teacher explained things well. The BIG problem with the course is that the level of the lectures no way matched the level of the assignments, especially the last one. It was way too hard compared to the material presented. It was supposed to take 3 hours but it took me more like 50 hours. And from the forum it seems like a lot of people spend 40 or more hours on this one last problem. Was too hard and too much. A lot of prayer and sweat I finally got it with a lot if discussion on the forums. But 40 hours for one problem is crazy. There needed to be a lot more thorough instruction in order to do this problem in a reasonable time.",3
90917,Its a really great project but one needs to have studied mechanical and really advanced level physics to do this project. But I really got help of the discussion forums to complete the assignments but am not yet clear about the theory of aerial robotics.,3
90925,"Includes advanced mathematics, I can only recommend this course to students who have a greater understanding of programming and math.",3
90929,The course is awesome in terms of topics covered. But the pace is too fast. moreover the lectures are not comprehensive. It is needed to put more material or refer some notes or books that might help,3
90933,"I truly love the course program and what it covers. And aiding student who can't afford the price by grants is relly nice. Then were students alloweed to download MATLAB freely! But teachers should be clear from the begining, what topics one must grasp before getting one's head into it. I don't think calculus and Linear algebra is enough, given some topics that are spoken about in the course. The teacher can explain mean things and in a second, speaks about totally incomprehensibe subject. Last but not least, I personally think the course lacks on additional materials. It would be really nice if there was something like handouts, pdf readings for deeper understanding of the concepts on offline times.",3
90940,"The course should be longer, more detailed and with more background lectures",3
90987,Very long assignment,3
90994,"Good course about NoSQL MongoDB. I learned a lot about the course but it would have been better if the instructor would have given some emphasis on programming with Unix machines like Macs. He used windows and in many cases I would run into problems like running Mongoid by including Gem files that he provided. I had to downgrade from rails 4 to 3 and then to 5, etc hitting StackOverflow every time to sort out technical issues.",3
90996,"Overall good course with a lot of examples. Though, some important steps seems to be missing, so could not follow along with all the demos. Had to spend some unpredictable amount of time digging into some questions (probably, it is fine, but the difference between 2 previous courses and this one in the program is vivid). I had a problem installing 'doorkeeper-mongodb' and it does not seem that this problem for a number of users. Good that it was not in the final project.",3
91003,This course was a challenge. Mostly because some core requirements of the assignments were not explained in the lectures. I spent more time searching google for information than I did the lecture videos because A. the lecture videos are not named or indexed in such a way as to make it easy to figure out which video to rewatch and B. in many cases the particular thing I was trying to do wasn't covered at all. It may be the instructors teaching style to get you to research yourself but I could have done that without paying for the course.,3
91005,The course's assignments (3 so far) are not very well designed.It takes me more time to search online and on the lecture's videos for information than to actually write and come to a solution. The lecture's videos show very little coding and they're more focused on explaining (redundantly) a key concept.I believe it would be much more easier for other people taking this course later on if the videos were more code-oriented.Greetings.,3
91012,Not such a great course. Lectures don't cover what is needed in some assignments. Week 3 assignment was the hardest I ever took. Just plenty of work to be done and small amount of that work is going to stay with you. There is a lot of space to improve this course.,3
91027,The course is good but it's stupid to make course only in chinese language.,3
91069,"I did not enjoy this class. It was hard to take notes, the conversation from the instructors was to casual.",3
91072,An interesting course even if you don't complete the assignments because you can expect to get around an 80% even if you fully grasp the subject matter due to the peer review requirement. The course would be much better without that requirement.,3
91142,Great course,3
91157,Mostly talking heads. Pretty good information. I'd like it faster. More dynamic talking heads could make this more watchable. Very generous of the World Bank to put this together.,3
91177,thanks for everythings my teachers:)I hope to visit you soon.,3
91201,It is ok but very small,3
91233,"A very decent approach and well balanced learning material. I just wish we could cover more knowledge and to my opinion, once a course slips under the ""Specialization umbrella"" it gets ruined and the experienced with it.",3
91253,too simple.,3
91287,nice course at least to start with,3
91298,good but supporting material are poor,3
91331,"Yes there're some pronunciation tips and situational conversation practice to help you get started, but in speaking of helping students to become a ""professional“ English speaker, I think the course still has a long way to go.",3
91349,"This course has a great potential, but the subject of each week was very superficial. The speaker is very good, your english is clear and easy to understand. The subject covered is interesting, but could be more deeper.",3
91383,Simple and Easy way to learn English,3
91432,Wish they gave more clear information on the calcuations.,3
91436,Content is good. But more is there in Presentation that we have to self read. It would be better if somebody explains in video. Because reading we can do our-self and lots of content are available freely. But we spend money so that somebody teaches us those things.,3
91509,"It has not enough content, you can just read the chapters 5 to 7 of PMBOK, and its the textbook that you'll use in this course.",3
91524,I would have liked better tools to do this type of work.,3
91561,Good Work,3
91569,This a well paced class which does a good job of breaking down the fundamentals of project management cost accounting.,3
91576,Lot of external links,3
91578,It is better to merge the content of all 3 courses in one... very less content,3
91583,"I don't really like the format. I want lectures from the instructor, not animation and slides.",3
91595,"This course showed a lot of pre-written code and exposed me to databases. I learned a lot, but felt like I DID less than in the previous specialization courses.",3
91628,I work seemed a little too light.,3
91632,"I felt that weeks 1-4 went at a reasonable pace, but the week 5 material was rushed. Those programs were written by the instructor and presented quickly as examples, but some of the content in the programs was not already known or presently explained, like the ""buffer"" built-in function (found in Chapter 3 of Dr. Chuck's book but not covered in the course) and the ""pass"" keyword, which I had to find in the Python reference manual for an explanation. The week 5 programs were quite advanced and I would have liked more time spent on explaining them and perhaps a related programming assignment or two to help us learn the material.",3
91647,Would've liked for assignments to be more independent.,3
91661,was expecting more on this.,3
91669,"The assessment materials are not free？ I mean it is totally make sense that charge for certificates. But you cannot finish your courses completely if you cannot access the quiz. And the charges are soooo unbearably high for college students. Still, the teaching is excellent.",3
91687,I think it can further explore the libraries and constructs of the algorithms.,3
91690,"I feel that this portion of this course did move a little too quickly in terms of introducing new SQL concepts. The first couple Python program demos has my head completely spinning, and I think this could be largely avoided by having a couple more slides piecing together the logic of the programs. Other than that, another great course!",3
91717,Assignments were way too simplistic,3
91759,not too many new things about Python. mostly introduction to Python capabilities in databases/overall pretty good class.,3
91792,Not so much hands-on work in this course.Give us more homework please! ;-),3
91811,A surface level look into creating a SQL database with Python. Skims over topics quickly and does not go into depth on how to write code effectively or build a database from scratch.,3
91831,The lecturer is honestly a bit slow in his coverage of content and his scribbling is untidy. He also seems to want to intentionally make SQL look like its very simple and avoids giving interesting facts which he thinks may complicate the content but would be good to know anyway.,3
91854,"Great teacher, nice range of topics, very well explained. Unfortunately assignments are trivial and boring. Anyway worth taking along with other courses from that specialization.",3
91869,There is not enough exercise.,3
91890,It seemed to me a little bit too superficial... It was almost only copying and pasting code...,3
91943,"The teacher was wonderful as always. The course is given with sqllite, I would have liked a bit more experience with raw SQL queries. But the course shows you how to create and manage your databases with Python in an efficient way.",3
91961,The course should have more details. It feels like a lot was skipped.,3
91993,It have low practice exercises.,3
92021,"Assignments are very easy, and there aren't easy to follow notes that one can use instead of always having to watch the videos.",3
92028,"It's OK. the lectures are good. The book needs updating, and more exercises would be helpful to practice what we learned in class.",3
92036,"Awesome stuff. Useful things covered, but the student should be able to be tested in creating himself code, not just run or (simple( edit the existing code.",3
92038,"Things are way to deep for not programmers, i did not enjoyed so much as the previous",3
92048,Nice course but didn't include enough python code for other database vendors and wasn't challenging enough,3
92054,"Very good, but rather brief. It does teach you the basics, but uses Python 2, not 3.",3
92082,The exercises need more work done if the students are expected to actually learn this stuff.,3
92119,"I felt like this course of the specialization wasn't as organized. First of all the object oriented class had no practical assignment, and while others did, they weren't contributing for the learning. I passed all the assignments but don't think I've mastered material here as much as in the previous courses of the specialization.It seems to me that material could be broken up into two courses, and because it's squeezed in one, the instructors have to provide 99% of the assignment and finishing the rest 1% is not helping in learning. Would be much better to be required to do more work in the assignments (possibly step by step and by splitting the course).",3
92138,"Exercises in the course were very poor, simple and did not require coding, just changing one or two lines. But topic was interisting",3
92182,I loved the teaching. The video are great and the examples too... But I almost did not program! The course is 'too easy' and I feel I did not practice enough!,3
92190,"plz last lecture in this course, you can better understanding to me.",3
92195,"I missed more details and exercises on the last part of the course. For example, that geoload/geodump/where-data could be given as exercises during the course and joined at the end to make that map solution.",3
92223,"Interesting content, well structure lessons but too easy assesments.",3
92235,"Very short lectures and easy assignments, but a good overview and starting point for further studies.",3
92272,"All homework were to modify from an existing code, and all lessons were skimming on indexes. I learned less than other courses from this series.",3
92276,I do not find this course is useful to learn seems it only gives a guideline to the python database.,3
92325,The course material was very good but the assignments were boring and unchallenging,3
92333,"Focused too much on SQL rather than Python, so not really that helpful for people who already know SQL (like myself)",3
92338,Could use more hands on coding,3
92344,"Course is interesting, but tasks are way too easy.",3
92349,I think it would be good to include into course following topics:1) NoSQL databases2) ORMs,3
92359,I think most of code should write enrolled students. How can you learn something just copying lines of code and making minor changes? Or just running already wrote code like in the last section?,3
92435,Good but need more practise problems in order to understand what you are learning,3
92436,I didn't know anything about programming and needed a lot of help with this course. I would have like more help in getting python and its complements install. Thanks.,3
92443,"A good introduction to Python, but the course is a rather short & I think more could have been said about genomics-specific functions, modules, etc. and how to use them.",3
92459,"I think someone who has never coded before can approach this course. However, further reading of the resources presented will augment what has been taught and to better handle the quizzes.",3
92463,"I enjoyed the lectures, but I felt they didnt go into enough details on analysis of sequence data. The final project was considerably harder than the material taught in the class and problems with the course (e.g. the final exam file not being available) had obviously not been fixed since the last version of the course. A fell I now have a good basic understanding of python but not enough to do any real analysis. Fantastic course mentor/TA.",3
92470,Can't easily understand one of the instructors. Dislike how it chops and changes instructors in the same course.,3
92488,"Good quality of videos and teaching materials, but I expected more content about gamification.",3
92586,"Thorough introduction in the world of strategic management for each and every one who is not familiar with this field of expertise. However, the modules could provide, through simple graphics and/or easy diagrams, a better understanding of the new principles and ideas that one encounters here. Moreover, there is room for improvement as far as bibliography and in general additional reading are concerned. All in all, the particular course offers a very decent view of this very interesting world of strategy but there are many ways that it could provide an even better experience and knowledge.",3
92634,It's clear and offers a very good foundation. Supplementary material is helpful. However in my view the course needs more practical illustrations of how some of the different strategy definition and approaches are practised (or not) today by modern-day companies. Some of the material was too abstract and was somewhat difficult to relate to.,3
92698,"More basic than I was expecting, I suppose it is an introductory to the specialization.",3
92711,Too much history,3
92750,Quite difficult to digest for a beginner. Hope the examples are easier.,3
92759,"I think that the course is good but the assignements are totally not at the same level of the explanations, except for the last assignement. The last assigment provided more information and more hints.",3
92764,Could do a better job of teaching more of the fundamentals involved in the Programming Assignments.,3
92777,"This course is too easy and more like a user manual, I wish there are more ""Why"" or ""principles"" inside. because the most important thing is to know ""why"". In my eye, ""functional programming Principles in Scala"" is this kind of real course that after taking it (it is not my priority right now so I will delay to finish it for a while). I can get the sense of the most important feature of a new language.",3
92782,The homework is more harder than what I learned. The errors in speaking made me uncomfortable.,3
92805,Not practical for beginners. Probably useful if you already have extensive experience with other programming languages.,3
92829,"Very simple course instruction and materials with difficult programming assignments. I understand having a student stretch for an assignment, but this seems more like incomplete instruction. Definitely a lot of work if you only have a statistical programming background.",3
92844,there were several things required in the programming that was not covered in lessons. Without help from other programmers and googling a lot I could not have done this. Very complex for beginners. Also documents not updated with current information,3
92846,Very interesting course - Thank you.,3
92863,"there is a wide gap between the videos, practice assignments and completing the required projects.",3
92878,"Even though the video lectures, discussion forums, swirl & reading resources are informative, there is a huge disconnect between the assignments & what is taught. It is impractical for people who have just been introduced to R(with no background in programming) to take up this course.The graded assignments should be made simpler or should be preceded by smaller ones which help first-timers get used to coding in R. I do not think Swirl; even though a valuable resource; achieves this task remotely.",3
92880,The instructor gave us homework on materials that were not taught in the lectures. This was a little unfair. It may be the way to teach for in-person learning but it is frustrating for an online course. Others have commented on the rapid pace. I would not mind the rapid pace if the materials presented were also the ones tested.,3
92882,nice to learn:)),3
92889,"Feels like there is an extreme disconnect from the tutorials/lectures and the programming assignments. The programming assignments, were at times, rather difficult and had little to do with the lectures from that week. Overall I feel like I have a decent base in R, however I still feel like a lot of concepts were lost/not explained thoroughly enough.",3
92927,"Good introduction and definitely helps get started! Given we have video lectures, concepts could have been explained better by demonstrating on the R console instead of showing static slides and verbal explanation.",3
92944,The assignment doesn't correspond with the content of classes closely.,3
92981,"I understand that it must be a great challenge trying to teach R in four weeks. I feel the lectures were clear, the supplemental swirl assignments were beneficial, and that the discussion boards were fruitful. However, the assignments were ridiculous. Google is your friend with this course, as always, but if you're looking to gain a lot from this course, pay close attention to the lectures and the supplemental assignments in swirl. The assignments, in my opinion, were beyond the scope of the lectures and supplemental assignments.",3
92984,There is a large gap between the course material and the assignments. Requires A LOT of extra research to complete if you do not have prior R experience.,3
92989,"Nice course, but the gap between video lessons and programming assignments was too wide for me. Would have loved more guidance towards the assignments.",3
93034,"The course is challenging and the exams use real-world data.The sequence of the course is not linear, the exams are too difficult compared to the material covered in classes.",3
93042,Solid course overall only complaint is the programming assignments are a bit difficult to do based on what is taught in the lectures.,3
93053,"Dr. Peng is great at teaching, and the lectures are not hard to follow. The recommended e-book is almost a transcript of the lectures' examples, and I really recommend getting it (I got it on print, as I like to make annotations while following the videos).That being said, the Programming Assignments are extremely difficult for anyone with no programming background. The Assignments do not require just what is being taught, and demands a lot of google and stack overflow research in order to solve the problems. If you are doing other Coursera courses and/or working at the same time, I recommend you invest time in this and do not let the assignments for the weekends.",3
93064,Good course. I would request that the instructors work through modules in real time that are similar to the quizzes.,3
93068,"I could not complete it as 100% because of a bug, in week 3 quiz and week 1 quiz. in week 1 2questions will never get a correct answer. Same case with week3 quiz.",3
93079,"Very challenging assignments! You learn a lot. Please, give more complex exercices to prepare before the final assignment.",3
93082,The course teaches you very valuable basic R programming skills. It is definitely good for the beginner. Unfortunately the lectures and course materials do not adequately prepare you for the programming assignments which is frustrating and time consuming if you actually want to write the code required and not cheat.The structure and functionality of Coursera itself is excellent.,3
93083,"I had indeed to look for codecamp to practice all the small commands how to deal with vectors. Swirl does not allow you to follow up so clearly. I wish you guys could implement a little R interface so we can follow you closer.The last project quiz demands you a huge amount of time, if you do not have much experience. They could shorten a little the questions. I know that one takes to the other, but I only had time to finish the first and understand. Yes, perhaps I am not the best, but you are offering the course to people who are not born programmers.I think that it would benefit strongly from a clear distinction between how to deal with vectors, matrix, data.frame, etc. separately instead of the huge videos with bullet points of the potentialities. We need to practice more, I like theory and I know how important, but I dont think that I learn much from the lessons or quizzes how to code something like the last part. I dont think it build my knowledge until I understand how to create that script for week4. I had to look around in all the internet, buying books. Read more. Just my opinion. I think you guys could give small scripts or asking smaller tasks to lead people until they understand how to build that.Also has its positives, I really learnt great tips and technically I know a lot of R potential.",3
93092,"It was a little difficult grasping functions as I didn't have much programming background. The swirl practice modules were great but I wish they constructed some lessons that would build a function from top to bottom like we were asked to do in the programming assignments. The lectures, swirl practice modules, and quizzes were great but they all re-iterated the same basic information. I wanted to learn and practice building more functions by applying the basic information to do complex tasks.",3
93099,It is not entry course! Please be well prepared!,3
93112,Training material and assignment levels don't match up. better training material and videos expected.,3
93122,"I understand why R was chosen to be the statistical software package chosen here, but I personally don't like it and professionally use SAS JMP.",3
93127,"Some of the material was not useful in completing the assignments. Profiling was not useful in this regard. While it is useful in the real world, it was unrelated to the assignments. Also, Better examples of functions like lapply, tapply etc. besides using random data would be more likely to make sense what the function is doing. Also, there are references to statistics/statistical methods that the student may have no background in. This is also not helpful for explaining the material. The video content is largely just reading the text of the slides. It takes much more time to watch the reading of the slides than just to read them. This is not the best use of video. Neither is watching the instructor sitting in his office talking. It would be better to see a concrete problem solved, and explain why the steps taken are used. The problem could be related to the assignments but different enough to not be copied. I had to rely heavily on online resources and help files to get answers to things I think should have been part of the course material, as this is an introductory class.",3
93130,It is not a beginner friendly course. Learn R from somewhere else and then take this course.,3
93138,"I learned from the lectures, but the lectures didn't prepare me to do the hmwk.",3
93152,It seemed like course material had little to do with the assignments. Teach us how to read alphabets and assignment is to write poetry. Big jump!,3
93168,"materials didn't cover everything necessary for assignments, and time requirement was not clear",3
93170,"It is easy to follow, it should be a 2 week university course, but IMHO it should cover more about the data type problems that can arise with R loose data types. It is focusing too much on the code profile concept without leaving interesting knowledge about that. It should cover better the native idea/implementation about computation as single instruction multiple data, which is not well covered. In the end, this is one interesting aspect of the language that makes it useful for data science.",3
93178,"although it gives an introduction to R, however the structure of the course overall was not up to expectation or objectives of it.the videos were very much theoretical and boring. Introducing too many concepts (although basic) was not related to the programming assignments. I had to google almost all assignments. It's arguable that this is one way of learning and more of realistic. But on the contrary, as I'm paying to get the knowledge I shouldn't be wandering around to understand something that should've been taught in the lectures.Moreover, I think that the videos need to be updated, the mentors need to be more involved in the forums, and the way the slides are presented within the videos should be more interactive or dynamic rather than being just captured lines of codes.",3
93181,Assignments are not good representations of course materials. The Instructor speaks too fast.,3
93228,Needs clear instructions,3
93232,not the easier way to learn R,3
93241,This was actually pretty hard. I felt like the questions asked in the quiz were considerable above and beyond what was taught - and the amount of R itself taught felt like being thrown in the deep end.,3
93263,"Overall a good crash course and introduction to R. Its a lot to learn in 4 weeks and some of the assignments were challenging (which I liked). I think the course is worth taking but I do wish the material and assignments were packaged better - more aligned. Just be prepared to spend a lot of time online reading, researching, and learning some concepts on your own. Don't expect to learn everything from the lectures and materials to be successful in this course.",3
93275,Pretty short introduction to R.,3
93278,"So the course is a mixed bag.PROS: The lecture content is useful, albeit a bit dry. I can't give them too much slack for the dryness, after all it's coding. However, they could have shown more real-time coding, rather than just scrolled through powerpoints with the Command Window pasted. You definitely need to have R open when following along with the lectures. The quizzes are also quite useful, as you're required to know both the background of how things work and use the commands learned from the lecture.CONS: The assignments assume you know a lot more than the basic knowledge, and there's no real way to know how to do the assignments just from the lectures. The quizzes tend to be on the easy side and the assignments ramp things up quite quickly. There's no intermediate material to test your skill. You have to have worked in R to have even a minor chance at succeeding on the assignments.",3
93295,"the presentations are very hard to follow, it requires a lot of extra time reading the professor's book",3
93296,"This course is very thorough, but I did not feel that the lessons often prepared me for the programming assignments. I found that I was frequently looking on the internet for additional resources and finding that I was definitely not alone.",3
93301,"I'm not saying R Programming has to be a gripping subject, but this course is pretty dull. The value of good teaching methods is often underrated in transferring knowledge.",3
93304,"It's ok that the instructor always talks fast, but he stammered a lot. Wish he could speak everything fluently.",3
93312,"Need way more content, and accesibility to begginers, gap between theory and practical exercises is too big!",3
93327,"Quiz and especially assignments were poorly written. Spelling mistakes in slides is simply unacceptable in high-level academia, in my opinion. Especially for a course designed for a global audience.",3
93352,"I really do not like the R language, I think it is sloppy and inconsistent. This class did ok teaching the basics of R, but it did not do anything toward teaching testing of R code (a key part of writing code!), best practices for modularization and factoring, and so on. In other words, it teaches you how to write R code that kind of works, but does not teach you how to write good code in R.",3
93353,Its good but found it a little theoretical.,3
93355,"I like the whole experience, but there are some gaps between sessions and weekly projects. I think this course can be improved with adding small tests between each session and providing several exercises as complimentary material. For understanding many topics I watch many other videos on youtube till I grasp the concept.",3
93368,the swirl exercise along with the course makes much more sense,3
93370,"It was very difficult for me to follow the exercises, since I don't have a programming background.",3
93374,"This course was mostly self learning. It gave me a framework to go along but what is presented in lecture and assignments are completely different. The discussion board and mentors are really good resources and can provide pointers to move along. It is definitely not a class that can provide sufficient information to learn and build applications, but the individual's effort in passing the quizzes and the projects will. It is up to the student to figure out through stack overflow, youtube, and other search result to figure out how to complete these assignments. I believe the assignments given from this class are realistic to real-world situations.",3
93416,I give this course 3 star not 5 star because the level of programming assignments are bit difficult as compared to level discussed in lecture videos. Although lecture videos are very informative but beneficial only for very basic level programming and to solve these programming assignments lots of learning is needed.,3
93424,"I felt that the programming assignments were not explained well enough, things like different syntax that wasn't explained and such. If the class required a lot of outside research not included in the class, they should mention that more clearly.",3
93426,"I really struggled - coming from a zero programming background. I recommend tons of reading, practical exercises, swirl is a bit of a savior and so is stackoverflow. Even with all of that, I struggled to get my mind to think like a programmer and structure the thoughts into plans for the assignments and tests. I think there needs to be a course before this that teaches one what the first step of solving a programming-related problem; eg one that focuses on flow charts, breaking down the question, etc... It literally is like learning a new language : you need to keep reading and practicing and watching/listening to others do it until you start to get it.",3
93439,very fast course that can be difficukt for young progrmmers,3
93440,"There is a high disparity between lecture content and the knowledge required to complete the assignments. It would be great to have a complete walk through of each assignment, showing the different ways in which the same functionality can be created, after having submitted an assignment. This would really had helped me to better understand why something is done in a certain way and improved my understanding of how R works. Currently there is zero feedback on completed assignments, which does not aid learning.",3
93449,"This was a decent introduction to R, but my main issue is that the Data Science specialization is so dependent upon the R language. This course really should be more focused around Python or be more flexible in general.",3
93465,This was a very necessary but boring class.,3
93475,R Programming is seeming difficult more hour courses are required to be initiated for making this language better learn among scientific community.,3
93478,"Course was good, but the material covered was at a fairly high level and done too quickly. This course could use some demos and since its a core foundation for the rest of the courses, maybe it should be a longer more in-depth program.",3
93479,i feel this courses needs to be split into two different streams. One for beginners and one for people who are more comfortable with coding and R. I think that the learning curve is too steep for a part time course.,3
93486,"The course lecture was ok, Swirl was pretty good. The assignment was confusing and the instructions were not very clear.",3
93497,straight and narrow.,3
93504,"It's okay, the explanations are mediocre as well as the assignments.",3
93511,"It would be better if it was more interactive. The videos aren't very helpful for a beginner programmer, and the assignments are pretty challenging. I still feel like I learned something though, but mostly from swirl which is a pretty cool thing!",3
93524,This course does not teach thoroughly. There is no direction or lead in to best practices.,3
93530,"If you have no programming experience in R, this is not the course for you,There is no link with the programming assignments and course slides.But a practice assignment is proposed at the beginning of the course in week 2.",3
93541,"it is NOT for beginner, the student should have ""more than average"" in the programming languages, in order to get benefit from this course.",3
93548,I miss practical exercises that can be used to prepare the quiz,3
93549,To many text on the slides. Video resolution is not adopted for smartphone (Asus zenfone 5),3
93553,the assignments have nothing to do with the presented material. Would have liked some practice of the concepts presented in the lectures as opposed to learning new things just to be able to do the assignment,3
93554,"A bit of a deep plunge if you've never coded before, yet too shallow to satisfactorily introduce someone skilled in other languages to the many peculiarities of R. I don't envy instructors trying to balance these two needs in such a short time.",3
93555,"Extremely hard programming assignments for people with little or no programming background. Even though these assignments were truly challenging and difficult to complete, the course complied with some of the proposed objectives.",3
93567,The course needs an update. Really poor presentation of the material although a lot of things are covered.,3
93579,"Learning R is very interesting and applicable. It is something I plan to continue, but not in the specialization offered here. The main reason being that the difficulty of the assignments seemed far beyond the material presented in the lectures. It could be that relevant examples on using applicable functions to aid in completing assignments were not presented in the lectures.",3
93597,"I am finding it very difficult to follow, feel like I am missing a chunk of information. However I will say that everyone else seems to be managing so it is probably me missing something",3
93599,Thought this course could've been much more effective. The content felt very random and esoteric at times. Especially the programming assignment on cached results. I get it. I'm a programmer at heart. But this is at the margin of usefulness. How about a segment on running regressions? Or doing some real data analysis?,3
93600,"Overall not a bad course. Needs some tidying up though. For example, the assignments seem to assume knowledge of functions not covered in the prior lessons. Same applies to the textbook, e.g. page 50 refers to the subset() function, but it is not actually covered.",3
93616,The difficulty of the assignments increases fairly dramatically week over week. It might be more productive to scale this content more gently by dividing it into a two-part course?,3
93637,I think the jump in difficulty from week 1 to week 2 is discouraging to many students with little to no R experience.,3
93640,its good and still more programming problems can be discussed to ease the learners to dive interest in R.,3
93644,In some cases I felt the course lecture (video) was bit tough to understand and few things could have been explained better. The Swirl complemented and filled most of these gaps.,3
93646,"1) This course is NOT for beginners in R programming. Huge gap between lectures and assignments. Swirl lessons are cool, but anyway they don't explain enough.2) I understand that studying is not always a joy, but lectures of this course are boring. First, slides come with brief comments of instructor. And second, it seems like the instructor speaks with no preparation as there are a lot of stammers, tongue slips, ""sort of"", ""kind of"" etc. It annoys a lot...",3
93647,"Huge gap between theory and programming assignments, however quizzes are interesting and require some time to complete.",3
93660,"It was a good class to begin with however it would have helped to tailor it more towards newcomers to programming language in general. I also would have like it if Roger would have highlighted or circled, or something to specify where in the slide he was talking about. I felt that at times it was hard to follow where exactly he was talking about and what part of the code/function he was mentioning. Im a visual learner and that would have been greatly beneficial.",3
93661,I wanted to love this course so bad but unfortunately I couldn't. There was a great distance from what was taught in the lectures and what was asked for you to do in the assignments... and It's not a matter of knowing how to program. I know Ruby and Python but R is a very peculiar language itself. Perhaps they should invest more on gradual exercises like the one they advised to do on github or some easy statistical exercises... Now I don't know if I should take the next module or if I should look for something out of here where I can learn R. I see potential on this course.,3
93662,"I have some programming experience, but I often could not understand the questions being asked in the programming assignments. Not because of my skill level, but the lack of clarity in the directions. I felt that I learned a lot while taking this course because it held me accountable, but the course design could be much smoother.",3
93675,"Assignments don't always align to the course content....In terms of usefulness and coverage of this course, this really is just the basics of R.",3
93681,Gets progressively tougher but loses momentum in the end. I highly recommend taking additional courses in R as the programming requirements are not exponentially increasing and by the end it suddenly peaks to a huge demand.,3
93704,Bit tough and the professor's were rushing through the course in videos.,3
93705,"Lectures and the homework are not quite relevant. The instructor explains so little on programming, but the assignment are tough.",3
93734,Good course overall but assignments have too little guidance in how they should be completed and can its easier to use material from future lessons to solve the problems,3
93745,The exercises ae far more advanced than the lectures and study materials.,3
93747,"The programming assignments are a great way to get your hands dirty with R, but this is not a course for someone without any prior programming experience, and I found the lectures didn't have much connection with the assignments.",3
93757,"Challenging, but it gives a good idea on rprogramming, should be taken with other learning tools outside coursera",3
93778,The connection between lectures and assignments needs to be improved.,3
93788,"I spent a year coding, working on other programming languages and came back to this one a second time. I had the same exact learning issues as before. Luckily I had a better background but still had trouble going from lecture to exams. Swirl() is great.",3
93791,Too much stuff is taught without teachings the basics of the language,3
93808,Good Introductory course on R language,3
93811,"The course had too much stuff crunched (and poorly explained) in too short a time period. That said, I got something out of it using a self-directed approach.",3
93813,"If you are a beginner, this course's assignments will be quite difficult to solve but not impossible. Nevertheless, the course will give you the incentive to try and learn on your own, with the help of Rforums, the Coursera discussions, Google etc. I would appreciate it if some things would be explained in more detail. A beginner most definitely needs more time to spend on the course than the hours estimated.",3
93816,"It was a decent introduction to R programming IF you already have some programming experience. I would never recommend this as a first programming experience to a novice programmer. That would be like throwing someone who has never swam in the Atlantic without a life boat! That said, if you have some programming knowledge to begin with, the Week 2 and Week 4 programming assignments were good. Week 3 was disjointed; it had NOTHING to do with the lectures from that week. I found the Week 3 programming assignment to be tor easy and, frankly, not very valuable as a learning tool.",3
93833,"The course is excellent and cover many tasks that usually you perform with R. However, on my opinion assignments are not really focused on the topic of the classes, they are not really explained and above the grade of the classes.",3
93867,The course videos are hard to follow. The Swirl package is good,3
93919,I didn't find the speaker very engaging. And his habit of bringing the dog into the classes was supremely bizarre.,3
93952,"Repeated the same view，too much time. I think it better to teach more about methods. All the worth is in the summary back of each unit, you even need not to have the course.",3
93978,Decent course to get an introduction to portfolio theory. Some work needs to be done to update the pdf slides with what the professor adds in handwriting during the course.,3
94000,"I think that I would like to be more concrete on topics, the teacher explain very well but then there is not that amount of concrete examples, so the classes gets very theorical,",3
94008,"Good course.However the initial part ,that is recruiting hiring portion could have been conducted in a better manner.It felt as if the lecturer was reading out from a text book.",3
94014,"It is a good general overview about recruiting, but I would like more information about staff planning as well, how to forecast the workforce needs.",3
94024,On later parts the videos are poorly edited and less interactive. In one place practice quiz has wrong answer marked as right. (Whether it's a situational question or behavioral).,3
94033,"I think the course needs to be restructured in order to be more practical and in order to go more deeply into theoretical material. Most of the course is a little superficial. Most classes could be summarized. For exemple, in talking about selection procedures, the only tool discussed more deeply is interview. The was no discussion about personality, psychological test or other tools. Most contents of Amy`s classes are abstract. Stacy class, however is more practical. It is a nice course, but it can go more deeply into theory and most classes could be summarized.",3
94036,"The subject is interesting and the instructors both seemed very competent.Still I wish the course had been better prepared as there were lots of sounds defects: you had to adjust the volume during each video which is tiresome. In the same idea, the questions during the course would pop up in mid-sentence, sometimes with too much anticipation with the subject at hand. Last, the questions in the assignments were sometimes not so much to check your understanding but your memory about a small detail like a % in a study that is already obsolete by the time we learn it...All in all a great course, with great instructors but still room for improvement as a mooc.",3
94038,"This course was a bit mediocre. The videos were often choppy, awkward, and cut off in the middle of sentences. The quiz questions were unclear and generally poorly written, and didn't make me think enough. I did enjoy the onboarding special topic section, and the quality was higher there. But the first 3 weeks need quite a bit of revision and fine-tuning.",3
94057,"Good material, but wish it had more assignments to hold you accountable.",3
94066,The assignment is difficult,3
94069,"The content of this course is excellent, and I've learned a tremendous amount. It would be a 5-star course if that were the only criterion.I've become discouraged about the lack of rigor in the quizzes. A standard practice for students in online courses, if a quiz can be taken more than once, is to take the quiz before studying the material. (This is a research-supported study technique; it focuses attention on key points in listening/reading.) I'm finding that the questions virtually give away the answers. On my trial-run attempt, before the videos, I score close to or above the passing level. Because the multiple-response answers are immediately visible, a student could boost into the generous passing range on a second attempt just by seeing which boxes should have been checked or left unchecked. I can usually achieve a score of 100% on three attempts before seeing any of the material.Questions could be more difficult by requiring more discerning application of the principles, or by requiring true recall (typing in rather than choosing the information in a multiple choice format). There are dozens of ways to make questions a more rigorous and authentic assessment of student knowledge; I'm sure you know and practice many of them in your face-to-face classes.The option to repeat the quiz fails as an assessment because the questions are repeated identically even after the incorrect answers have been indicated -- and in the multiple response questions, this means that the correct answers have also been shown. A person with no knowledge of the subject matter should be able to score 100% in a maximum of 4 attempts at the quiz, just by trying each answer on each question. Thus the quiz is not any kind of assessment of actual knowledge.The assignments do require a demonstration of some ability, but the grading scheme is sufficiently generous that a person who follows the instructions minimally will earn enough points so that, in conjunction with quiz scores, they pass and receive the certificate for the course.This certificate program has high visibility in social media right now; it would be a shame for the certificate to devalue rapidly when it becomes clear to employers and students that the certificate does not, in fact, indicate that a person has passed any minimal threshold of knowledge or skill.It may be that the Capstone project is graded quite rigorously, so that any slackers from the previous classes will not earn the certificate -- but that's a bit devious too.",3
94075,"More like a 3.5 to 4? Close to 4. The main problem for me with this course was the assignment. I found it a bit unclear. The instructions are clear, but the way to go about completing the assignment was not. The last assignment we had in Course 3 was very specific and even had a video specifically on how to complete the assignment and why each step was important. We were given an example as to how to perfectly complete the assignment to extract the maximum knowledge from the course. In this course, that aspect was a bit lacking",3
94103,good but videos are too long,3
94106,It was a fast and easy course. I thought it could use more insight from other instructors. The links to other videos were useful on the text documents that were available to read.,3
94151,"Good frameworks that make a foundation. This course makes me realize selling is a critical skill. And Craig has done a great job at demystifying it. However, a lot of it is writing your own tool kits, assuming you already have successful sales experience. But that's what I realize I lack and that motivates me to take the course from the first place. If I had the right sales approach, then I would have been super successful already. Therefore, I would like to see more real examples that delve into the complexities of real-world selling situations. Also, Craig has an awesome personality: super high energy, very eager to engage; this makes me wonder the extent to which one's personality determines the effectiveness of the selling process. I, for one, am more of an introvert; so this begs the question if the introverts will need to do something differently to be as effective as the extroverts such as Craig. So, I encourage showcasing different approaches from already experienced salespeople from a wide range of personalities. In sum, I encourage the faculty to take this course to the next level by incorporating situational cases and how sales people of a wide range of personalities have handled difficult sales situations successfully, and/or how someone else have handled them unsuccessfully.",3
94190,"First I want to thank very much the instructor in the online forum. He helped me a lot at the end of the course and his tutorials for gh-pages are excellent. He was also very fast in responding. Thank you.The course did ultimately not really gave me what I was looking for. Maybe too may different facts and not enough depth. I am not sure that I can confidently say that I can build a ML model now. Technically I can, but the deeper understanding is missing. For example: When would I use which method (for example rf versus naive base), the last exercise about cross validation was not fully clear. Using the caret package is too high level for a learner. It would be better to see some more step by step examples. It was not clear to me what the expected error calculation in the last exercise was really looking at. Maybe what is missing a swirl exercises, not using caret. and then explaining how caret can simplify it. We also learned how to create a predictive model, but did not go into how the model gets updated and gets retrained, an important aspect of ML. i also do not see unsupervised learning to be covered.",3
94193,"This is such a cornerstone topic to the Data Science Specialization that I think it deserves a better designed and more polished curriculum. The subject is so extensive that it might be worthy to split the contents in two courses. Finally, I would like to suggest the authors of the course modeling the curriculum following the amazing treatment of the subject found in ""Introduction to Statistical Learning"" by Hastie, Tibshiriani et. al.",3
94207,Instructor rushes the course and does not explain much in the same level of details as respective quiz requires,3
94209,"While the overview of the content seemed very reasonable both in scope and pacing, the lack of swirl exercises meant that the final project for the course was a bit jostling. Overall, I think this course still needs some development in the way of exercises to familiarize the student with the practical exercises associated with machine learning.",3
94210,"mentorship was great, but the video lectures were almost useless.",3
94212,I like initial courses like Exploratory Data Analysis but later on it got harder to follow the lectures. A lot of topics were just rushed through and little effort was made to make them engaging or interesting.,3
94216,"The videos are really tutorials on R functions for machine learning and data wrangling. A good substitute for ""Machine Learning"" by Andrew Ng in terms of managing data sets and exploratory analysis.",3
94219,"Superfluous but the existence of the package ""caret"" covers the gap of other libraries like ""skilearn"" of python",3
94234,Materials in class are not suficient to understand the subject. There is missing swirl excercises and other hands on practical work. In Data Science specialization this one is the one with most space for improvement. Keep the good work. BR,3
94235,Too different for beginners but not deep enough for ones already know R.,3
94241,"The topic is too big, for one course from my point of view.",3
94248,"Although again very interesting, I found the lack of additional materials such as practical exercises, swirls and a book reduced the depth of the course knowledge for me. Maybe we have been spoiled by the previous courses :-)",3
94254,Good enough to open up mind of researcher,3
94256,"Exercises could be more complete, and some are outdated for latest R, giving slightly different results.",3
94257,Fair but assignments are not very well explained,3
94262,Lectures are too complicated. I understand that material is not easy and one should do a lot of research and reading to understand the essence of the taught algorithms but the lecturer is also not very helpful and assignments are everywhere on the internet which nobody needs to get tired of thinking a little to do the homework as their product.,3
94264,Quizzes are useful exercises but need to do a lot of self studying.,3
94281,"Good course for learning the basics of the caret package. However, it is not a good course for learning machine learning.",3
94303,too easy,3
94306,"As as standalone course on machine learning, it's probably best to take Andrew Ng's class on Coursera. This course mostly teaches the basic usage of the caret package. It is too short to cover more fundamental topics in machine learning, like how to choose an algorithm based on the problem and the data.I took this class just because I was engaged in the Data Science specialization. I wanted to clear the Capstone project and get the Data Science specialization certificate.",3
94312,In my view the course was useful but not as good as the previus ones I followed in the specializacion (such as regression models and stat. inference).The subject was too broad and there was no space to cover in detail all the algorithms. Also I think it's a bit out of date because there is no references to xgbboost which is now dominating many Kaggle contests,3
94316,"The course feels rushed. I understand teaching Machine Learning in 4 weeks is impossible, but then maybe the course needs to have a narrower yet deeper scope rather than throw at you many concepts without details. e.g. trees, random forests, bagging and boosting all in 10 minutes each? Impossible...So, as opposed to creating machine learning intuition I feel the course became an R package code book.",3
94321,"The quizes do not match a 100% with the lecture videos. There are some weird questions. My algorithms' outputs deviate from answers some times, which is due to different software versions. Quizes are not very educating this time. Courses by Brian Caffo were much better.",3
94343,Compared to previous two courses in specialization this one is far worse - it is more of excursion into used methods than actual learning using any of mentioned methods in enough detail to be able to do meaningful analyses.,3
94350,"If you have taken Andrew Ng's machine learning class, it's not necessary to take this one.",3
94365,the lack of assisted practices made it harder to digest the contents and methodologies.strongly suggest to develop some practice problems with explanations.,3
94368,"I'm somewhat disappointed. I attend almost all other courses in this specialization (except of ""data product"") and this one is, on my opinion, the weakest one. A lot of links to useful information though. This is more reference guide rather than a real training course.I can say even more, initially I start other courses of this specialization just because they were marked as strong prerequisite to this one. For now, I think all other courses of the specialization were much more valuable for me than this one.I've also took Andrew Ng course on Machine Learning in the past, and my learning experience was much better. In lectures on some concepts (like regularization) I'm pretty sure I would not understand anything if I had not been familiar with the subject before..",3
94369,"Class materials and videos are confusing and do not go into enough detail. Assignments require a lot of search of extra information outside course materials. Also, the length that is needed to complete the assignments vary widely week to week.",3
94375,more needs to be taught in class. what is taught is not sufficient for quizzes.,3
94377,"I believe this course is critical and much needed given where the Industry is heading. Prof Leek, has tried his best to explain the concepts in a lucid manner, however the complexity of the content, may challenge most students.A few more examples with R code would have been helpful as translating problem statement to R code may not be intuitive.I would highly recommend that students should plan to study some advance statistics before attempting this course. Having said that, i think this is a wonderful starter course to get a glimpse of what Machine Learning is all about.",3
94381,"Feels like everything is solved using a caret package, while the back-end theory is only slightly touched. By using a single line command solver, student may lack the foundation for harder problems in the real world.",3
94391,Quite a lot of material to cover in such a short time!,3
94396,Lots of material needs additional study (from different sources) as it's only summarily explained. Much math without the link to the praxis :-(,3
94403,Many things are not clear enough in multivariable regression part.,3
94414,"This course is great, instructor is good, however, the material of this course is not well organized, even the swirl practice is not put in the correct week, not in the same pace as the lectures. The quiz and project are far much easier than lecture content.",3
94420,"Very interesting course, yet course content could be spread more evenly (week 4 is really a lot)",3
94437,"Requires much more than a month to digest the material and complete the assignments. A default/initial one-week offering is too tight unless you are only taking the course (not working). I know one can complete the course in more than a single round and I did that but I still don't think the expectations should be set for a single month.Instruction (video content) can be much better, at least compared to a lot of other courses on Coursera.",3
94446,"I am no used to this educational system so I find difficult to follow without any proof or demonstration of the mathematical tools. I find proofs necessary for a good understanding of concepts. Another benefit of proof will be to have a more rigorous framework for variable names in the explanations. Even though this is more a practical course, it will benefit from being a bit more rigorous ; so at least people can make proofs on they own.Other than that, it is a great course. Very practical and to the point.",3
94451,"I enjoyed the earlier courses more. I did not like the way the materials were provided. There were a lot of very complex ideas were presented, in a very concise and brief manner. Also, there should be more exercises to practice. May be its me, but, I guess, I might need more time to fully comprehend the materials.",3
94459,the lecture notes is a bit confusing,3
94464,"Given the importance of this subject, this course should have been split in two or more or have a longer duration to properly address subjects as GLM or model selection techniques.",3
94493,"The course is good. Unlike the previous courses I took in this track, there was almost no interaction in the forums and also no-one to give feedback. I wonder if there were any TA's present in this run.",3
94496,"This course is better than Statistical Inference, and I think it is as useful. Non credit excersise are still very good at helping with understanding in practice what is going on.",3
94502,"I found the videos tough to watch. I was hoping for something that would be more practical for non-statisticians, but the lectures mainly devolved into mathematical proofs. That said, I did learn some from this class. Just not as much as I'd hoped.",3
94503,"This is a decent class, covering linear regression and a few of its variants in good detail. It's a challenging subject, but presented acceptably here.",3
94504,The instructor is at time incomprehensible. It would be helpful to speak more slowly and pause more often. Otherwise he sounds like repeating something that he's so well memorized after many years of teaching.,3
94508,"The material presented was of course useful, but I never really felt like I understood how it all tied together, or what the big picture was. I think that some case studies that show how all of the concepts relate to one another, or how they are used in the bigger picture would be helpful.Also, as a suggestion, I feel that if something is important enough to be included in the quiz, it merits more than the briefest of mentions in the lecture.",3
94513,I think this course needs more emphasis on practical applications and less mathematical background.,3
94523,"The flows of courses instructed by Caffo(Statistical Inference and Regression Models) are too long to concentrate it and the quiz is not quite related in lecture.However, Contents of the book is really good, as well as homework in the book.",3
94534,There's just something about the course content that is difficult to attain. It's presented at way too high of a level without enough tangible examples of getting down into the weeds of how to actually perform and interpret the models and functions.,3
94535,"good quick overview, could have more actual R examples in lectures",3
94537,"As for the Statistical Inference course, this course is amazing but is presented in a more complex way than it should be. Once again the concepts are simple and the math not so hard, yet I had to do a lot of research outside the course to be able to understand these simple concepts and derive the not so hard mathematics.Brian Caffo is clearly brilliant and, I would say, seem to be a good lad too, but something is missing. Too often the details are thrown at us without being properly framed in the context or without having the proper concept being introduced progressively.I have a theory about teaching since I was 15, and so far it has proven to be true. Imagine that learning is about climbing a mountain in which tall steps have been carved. Each step is taller than the student. The teacher is somewhere higher than the students (not necessarily at the top, if there is such a thing).The job of the teacher is to throw boxes (concepts) and balls (details) of different size, shape and colors. The job of the student is to catch these boxes and balls and to put the right balls in the right boxes in order to make a staircase out of it to climb (at least) one of the giant stair up.A good teacher makes sure to throw the concepts first than the details and to clearly specify which balls go into which box, as well as which boxes go inside/over which other boxes.But most teacher simply throw the balls and boxes in an not so well structured manner, so the poor students try to catch as many as he can, but also miss a lot of them. His hands can hold a limited amount of balls. If he doesn't have the right box to put them, he would either miss the next balls, or put the one he hold in his hand in the wrong box.Bottom line, the best teachers are those who focus on the concepts (and context) and make sure that the concepts are well understood before introducing details to stuck in these concepts. From my experience our brain (or at least mine) better learn this way. It is as if our brain need first to establish a category-pattern (the concept/context) to which it will associate detail-patterns. But without a proper category-pattern, our brain is having a hard time to properly remember the detail-patterns or miss-associate them to the wrong category-pattern (which create even more confusion).Hope it was helpful somehow...",3
94539,"This course goes on a very fast pace and simply does not have the charm of all the other courses in the specialization. I understand that a lot of content is covered within a month, but there should be supplementary course material available. Moreover, TAs should be more active on the forums. I have seen most of the questions just being discussed among the students. A little disappointed. Will probably have to watch all the material again to have confidence with it.",3
94542,"Better than Stat Inference, and gave some reasonable intuition, but could be improved I think by focussing on more understanding and less maths and formulas. Some of it did seem to be - here' s a formula, plug the numbers in to get the quiz question right, whereas in reality (in the world of work) that question is completely unrealistic - you have raw data and you need to do the regression and understand what it means.",3
94545,I find it very tough to understand everything. Buying the course book helps to overcome this. You have to dedicate a lot of time.,3
94555,"I enjoyed this course very much. Had value. I watch Scandinavian TV and films from the U.S. via Netflix, Amazon and MhZ Choice via livestreaming. In the future I would like more emphasis on recent or current Scandinavian film including actors, actresses, cinematography techniques, etc. Also, the video lengths were fine but the presenters need to be trained and give more engaging, lively presentations --- a bit too classroom ""lecturish"". Thank you!",3
94567,I found the lectures very interesting; but was surprised at how the quizzes / assignments focused so much on facts and figures - surely these aren't nearly as important as understanding the content?,3
94582,"Very good course as a starting point. Although it still shall be better if there could be more detailed, academic study contents involved. And in addition, it might be both more inspiring and more attracting if the lecturer giving the information with more spoken presentation which approaching to a real class rather than a fixed script text.",3
94612,"The video is ok, but it lacks a lot of details in calculation. The assignment is very confusing because some questions refer to some 'previous' statement while fail to clarify which is related.",3
94636,"Very uneven. There are some good insights and ideas in there, but no way will a beginner be able to make sense of this. It's more like a sort of refresher/inspiration course.",3
94637,"The course starts with a nice mathematical support. Midway it looses connection with mathematical details in a way that it becomes too vague and does not empower the student to really grasp the concepts. Some energy-based proofs and the few formulas presented are inserted a bit adhoc and not properly explained.Despite not being to my liking in terms of depth, It is a good course as a general understanding of what has been accomplished in robotic legged-locomotion, what the state of the art is and where to find literature.",3
94638,"Interesting class, but somewhat frustrating at times. I found the quizzes very conceptual, which was interesting, but trying to find the correct answer with no feedback as to how something was right or wrong made for a weaker learning experience. Had there been some feedback to understand why something is correct or not, I think that would enable more learning.I also think more emphasis on Forward Kinematics and Inverse Kinematics would help ground this class as a more general class for students interested in robotics. Introduction to Jacobians and how we can calculate end effector forces with respect to joint torques would really help interlace this class with some of the other classes in this Robotics specialization. It seems like it sticks out the most.Still. Interesting class and I learned some new stuff!",3
94645,"The course is not bad, but the information of the slides doesn't gives you much information to solve the questions. You have to go to other resources to solve the math questions.The simulations are OK, very practical and comprehensive but there is no math information about the movement or equations of motion on the slides, off course, if you have the matlab code you can do reverse engineering and aim the goal. If you expect to learn about robotics motion and mobility you have to go to other books of these themes.There are too much questions in my opinion and are tedious to solve or answer.",3
94652,many subjects are not clear enough.it is better to put links and pictures than send us to look in lectures for a specific time frame.and still it was very interesting and motivating course. thanks!,3
94654,"The Course material and method of testing the understanding of the student needs to be improved. Despite the low quality of the quizzes, the course is very inspiring. The examples showed are very good and the lectures concentrated on teaching the underlying concept rather the Mathematics involved, which was refreshing.",3
94664,Good course. Stands well in the specialization. It was a bit buggy throughout tho. And the assignments could have focussed more on the control part.,3
94665,There must be something wrong to spend time on google&wiki much more than the course content.,3
94669,Good teachers but a lot of questions in the quizzes were very ambiguous and unrelated to the Course Content.,3
94672,"Very interesting course, both tests and assignments aredemanding but fair.Biggest problem of this course is that not all required topics are coveredenough in lectures.",3
94680,"Nice high level overview of the motion of robots. I would have liked to do more programming (modeling of robots, controllers, etc.) in the course and have the lectures tie in closer with the content of the quizzes. The TAs were very active in the forums and helped clarify/fix any problems that came up.",3
94788,"knowledge-based, no skill-based work at all which is weird since the capstone is skills-based",3
94803,Course is awesome but the final 36 questions are really a headache.,3
94848,It was good but so introductoryInstructors just reading the documents,3
94856,"The course laid out the concepts pretty well but if one had access to the materials, the lectures were not really necessary to understand the concepts.This was because the lectures were pretty much a re-reading of the materials and more importance could be placed on creating scenarios where the processes would be applicable. This would be a far better use of the lecture time than trying to combine the two and not doing a good job of either.",3
94868,Could be more in-depth (e.g.Kanban part...),3
94886,"Interesting review of many of the theoretical aspects. It completely lacks practice though. No exercises, no real world scenarios...",3
94887,"The lectures were done well. The tests should have more ""Real world scenario"" questions, then just asking about specifics terms used in a given process",3
94895,"The course way OK, but it had some flaws.It was very general and could have gone into more detail, but that was intentional, I guess. No big deal. Then again, the difficulty was way too easy and the quiz questions should be tested for test wiseness. What I disliked the most: The way Scrum was introduced and mapped to the role of a ""product manager"" was very confusing.Still, not a bad course though.",3
94948,"A lot of the practical materials in the courses are taught by the TAs, most of whom tend to speak in a monotonous manner and failed to teach at a pace that matches the difficulties or complexity of the content. There is no slowing down or speeding up for hard-to-grasp or easy materials. Also, it seems to me that they are delivering the lectures by reading line by line from a piece of paper.",3
94976,"Good general guidance, Richard Sellers was the most useful. Interesting how even established in a career can be considered a ""generalist"".",3
94996,"The course doesn't feel complete, the information and techniques used for assignments can be found completely online through documentation and instead this is merely an exercise for doing basic analysis through documentation rather than an explanation of python through data science (which is what I anticipated)",3
95002,a decent introduction into the world of python dataframes via the pandas library,3
95009,"The explanation and content in teaching video is too brief for the assignment. It cannot not provide sufficient concept and knowledge for student to complete it, especially who not familiar with pandas.",3
95016,Much more difficult assignments than taught in lectures,3
95031,Lectures are too fast!,3
95051,More programming details should be included.,3
95068,"For me the course's biggest value-adding point is to simply ask us to Google everything on Stack Overflow to complete all the assignments, which has almost nothing to do with the course content. The assignments are also badly designed. In the discussion forum you can see lots of confused / frustrated posts. The TA's and mentors are clearly under-resourced to answer all our questions. The videos unfortunately don't teach us much either. The professor + TA's a simply reading off a teleprompter, and they're rushing through everything. I've done some amazing courses on Python also offered from Uni. of Chicago, but this course has been a big disappointment unfortunately...",3
95078,Please provide more lectures. We depend on self-learning more than lectures in order to pass.,3
95079,Good and necessary introduction to Python. But especially Assignement 3 regarding cleaning the data should be improved. It´s good to know how to clean the data but it´s confusing when Q1 is apparently correct but actually it´s not. Mabye it would be better that Q2 - Q13 based on a new dataframe which is correctly by all means.,3
95087,"I learned so much. However, the lack of support when I got stuck made it a frustrating experience. I would not have been able to pass without the discussion forum tips. Even then, it was a lot of mucking in the dark and assignments took longer to complete than they should have. I'm glad I took the course but it was not designed for someone at my skill level. If the discussion forum was organized in a better way, it would have helped -- I had to scroll through pages of text to find the right tips to identify my mistakes. Sometimes the question requirements were oddly or ambiguously phrased and I misunderstood the expectation for the function being tested.",3
95092,Difficult. I cannot recommend this course to everyone but just technically minded people.,3
95093,This course relies almost exclusively on self learning of the details of pandas. It would be greatly improved by examples of how to use pandas to solve problems similar to the assignments.,3
95118,The course lessons could have been more specific and provide more explanations on many topics that are later required in the assignments,3
95120,"The whole curse relies on the automated grading system, which is still a little sloppy. I think it would be useful to have one notebook or cheatsheet with all the important functions. And also, I personally like to have a reference assignment that was completed by the instructors. This could be provided before or after the course, but the way I really learn is by reading other peoples code and seeing ways to code problems. Thanks",3
95123,The course instructor could have been more elaborate with the examples. I felt there was a wide gap between the exercises and the course material.,3
95132,"Honestly, it was a good crash course into data science in python. My 3/5 star rating comes from the fact that I think their could be more content / examples shown in the videos. The videos were a good start into the assignments, but I had to spend hours reading on the internet to really understand enough to complete the course.I liked what I saw in the videos, just wish there was a little more substance.",3
95141,"Only 37 minutes of video, average per week. Really nice, pleasant video, but don't expect to learn how to solve the problems, because there is little connection from the problems to the videos.Teaching assistants are hard -working and knowledgable and each has a different way to do things.Very little in the way of effective educational design.But they do create useful questions to answer, if you are stubborn enough not to need actual instruction.The estimate of time required is woefully inadequate.The best thing you can do is lookup Brandon Rhodes on Youtube. He will actually explain Pandas. Expect to invest about four hours in his videos and still have questions. Use the course forum extensively — only there will you get a hint of how to do what they ask.Google and Stack Overflow: that's their extensive list of references.",3
95144,"The course was helpful in presenting typical problems in data science, but the lectures showed you examples in one area of pandas and the assignments asked questions in different areas of pandas. I found the assignments frustrating and spent much of my time trying to understand what they were asking rather than actually solving the problems.",3
95146,"I enjoyed and found all of the lectures helpful, but lack of feedback after submitting assignments was a real problem, especially for the last assignment. A simple response of ""this was answered incorrectly, points not awarded"" isn't very constructive and was often frustrating. Bugs in being able to submit the assignment were also frustrating. I spent a good amount of time trying to fix my code, thinking it was incorrect, when in actuality the online submission was just not working.",3
95147,"The course content and assignments are pretty good at covering the fundamentals of how to manipulate data in python, I did learn a lot that I can see my self applying practically.Where it falls down though is the assignment auto-grader. It's immensely fussy (as I understand it has to be), but the assignment instructions are often very vague and don't sufficiently explicitly define whats expected. This means you spend more than 50% of your assignment time debugging and recasting objects and getting very frustrated whilst doing so.I would recommend this course, but I do hope that the course administrators pick up on this feedback and make the assignments clearer in the future.",3
95149,"From my poitn of view more lessons are needed, achieving exercises require a deep search on stackoverflow and other courses. That shouldn´t be the goal of the course, I expected the lessons to give enough knowledge to fullfil the questions of the exams",3
95173,"The course is fast paced and the videos do not cover all of what is necessary to know to pass the assignments. However, this is not a problem as all the necessary references are given. The problem is the way the programming assignments are designed and the automatic grader, which should definitely be improved. Some times you spend hours to figure out what is wrong and you finally find out that you have a precision error because of using a library function instead of another (same purpose) or you spend our to manipulate a Pandas dataframe to respond to the specifications, except that all that time is wasted as the grader will accept the first version even if the index does not respond to the requirement (for instance). So, if you want to take it, prepare to fight with the grader. Positive point: Excellent help on the forums, you will not be left alone.",3
95179,"I do have background in OOP programming but not Python. But I do also programming in MATLAB. I chose this course to learn more about technical skills to do research in data mining, data science, and machine learning. The instructor is fine but the lecture note is not really helpful. Students need more clear written information than just lecturing in Video as referring to lecture notes as needed would be more efficient. Each week assigns one programming assignment consisting of multiple problems. I don't think the shown expected time to complete each assignment is totally unrealistic. It took tremendous time to complete and at least to pass it. One good thing is that as far as you complete it within the session, there is no penalty and you can get the passing scores. However, all the programming is graded by the autograder which has a lot of bugs. For example, the exactly same solutions that was passed by the autograder as correct previously are graded as incorrect in the next trial. The staff people try to help but I totally don't understand their approach in that 'this may help but I am not sure if the autograder can accept it'. I believe they try to fix the bugs and use the 'trustworthy' autograder so students can rely on the feedback provided the autograder. We are not learning how to make the autograder not generate errors. I believe many of students are taking this course to improve their career performance. In my case, I am working as a full-time while I am taking this course. Due to the lack of time and the inefficient/faulty autograder, I took a lot of my precious time. I got passed this course with 95 and will continue taking the rest of the courses in this specialization because I already paid the whole specialization package and supported by my company. But I believe the staff team should improve the technical aspects so students can save a lot of their time. Also many of the programming problems do not have the sufficient level of clarity. For each problem, there should be an example so students do not have to spend too much time to understand or guess the solution. I found many inconsistency in the solutions although I guessed it by spending a lot of time to pass this course.",3
95181,"Course lectures were good, tho at times a little too rapid. The python text appears and disappears too fast to digest, I did a lot of pausing.The early exercises were good, but later ones were finicky. I would prefer more intermediate steps to confirm we're on the right track. In particular the last (huge) exercise was frustrating, just being told I've got it wrong with no feedback on why.",3
95182,"This course would be great if you are experienced in Python or any other programming language. The title ' Beginner Specialization. No prior experience required.' is very misleading and if you do not have any experience, you will struggle a lot especially to complete week 3 & 4 assignments.It makes you think and requires a lot of self-study, which is a good way to enhance our knowledge and skills, however assignments are way too challenging for those who are 'beginners' or have little real-world experience. I would not recommend if you do not have much confidence in your programming 'experience'.Having said that, teaching team is great - very knowledgeable and supportive.",3
95189,"In my humble opinion, the Python ramp-up in week 1 is not sufficient to effectively complete weeks 2-4. This course necessitates a bit more practice in Python. The lectures are cut-and-dry, and I recommend frequently referencing them when completing the assignments. I spent about 1.5x the listed time-to-complete on most assignments. On the flip side, I gained a lot of knowledge by putting forth full effort.",3
95214,"Good introduction of working with tabular data in Pandas dataframes. I've learnt how to access columns, rows, and specific values in a dataframe. How to transform the data. And how to merge dataframes together. The assignments are a lot of do-it-yourself by reading documentation and Q&A sites. So you're forced to read a lot, and learn more than actually necessary. Teacher and mentors gave hints on the discussion forum which helped. Could have been better if part of the solution is given. E.g. answer = 0.0073.........64 without actually giving the full answer. I also think the automatic grader should give an explanation or example of a correct answer when the assignment is answered correctly. It would have been better that way, because I could review the strengths and weaknesses of the methods I used to get to the answer.",3
95224,This course was over all okay. My primary complaints are that I felt that the class moved too quickly and relied too heavily on students to teach themselves through the Pandas documentation. The Pandas documentation is really only so-so and it would have been nice to have more guidance through the course materials.,3
95247,"Last assignment was *painful*: Poorly described instructions, outcomes/outpu; the grader was opaque and largely mute.",3
95266,"Although I learned a lot in this course, I found the lectures and assignments to be much too different from each other. I would like to see assignments where you must practice what is learned in the lecture. For myself, I feel I learned 1 set of concepts from the lectures and another set from the assignments by spending time on stack overflow and the pandas documentation. Both are good but the lectures and assignments did not ""flow"" together as I would have liked.",3
95280,"Skills acquired when finishing this first course are very useful and applicable. However, lectures and assignments are almost unrelated. This course is nothing for people who are new to python.",3
95282,"I found this course useful since I had no previous experience of Pandas or the statistical features of Python. I have programming experience and feel I would have found it quite a challenge otherwise, but not prohibitively so. Chris is great at explaining things in an accessible manner, and I'm very much looking forward to going into more detail in the rest of the specialisation. I would have enjoyed a little more focus on statistics etc and a little less on the mechanics of the library, but understand why it had to be approached this way.",3
95292,"I liked that the course was very assignment-oriented. It had a good structure and interesting additional readings. However, for people who are not familiar with pandas library it may be very challenging to pass assignments. This minimal guidance, I believe, results not in a better understanding, but in confused students writing bad code and spending hours not understanding online documentation. Overall, I really liked the idea and content of the course, but not how instructors approached the self-learning part.",3
95310,It was a good course where i learned about new and great tools and techniques. I learned how to approach the data science problems using Pandas and Numpy. This would not serve as a great course for into to data science. Background with Database Management and Python really helps. Overall i learn about new and great tools and would definitely require Documentation while using the skills i learnt in this course. Overall Great Job by Professor Brooks. Would love to take more courses by him.,3
95312,"Classes moved very fast, especially in the video materials. Functions were introduced briefly without time to digest. While I ultimately did learn the topics through my own research, I feel the class would have been much more beneficial with slower, more indepth explanations.",3
95330,"The course is quite demanding from the get go. If you are trying to get by with casual interest, then this is not the course for you. Much of my December vacation (which I had earmarked for playing video games) was spent coding on this course.The biggest gripe I have about the course is the grader system. It gives a binary output indicating whether you got the question right or wrong. Unfortunately, often that is not good enough, to debug your code. I spent hours figuring out what's going on. The forums were also not helpful, since there were not many taking the course.At the end of all this, if I ask myself, did I learn a lot? The answer is probably no. However, I did get a lot of coding experience. Debugging experience.We have many databases (MySQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, etc), which have far more powerful features than what pandas can do. Therefore, as a system designer, it is unclear to me as to why I would ever pick Pandas over the rest. It appears quite slow (compared to the likes of time tested databases). It offers very few features (when compared to a DB). Lastly, I can use it only with Python. To me, it appears to be a no-brainer to use any one of those DBs to store, modify and massage my data. Maybe there are valid applications that can make use of Pandas like features, but I did not learn that from the courseSummary:Better Motivation to use Pandas over standard DatabasesBetter grader design.",3
95334,"In my humble opinion, this course does not have a correct balance of difficulty of new concepts/tools with the exercises given by the course to practice. It is a ""hey, look, there is something called pandas out there that may be very useful for you"" but it is too introductory. And I know the course has the word ""Introduction"" in the title but that does not grant, in my opinion, to run a 4-week course such as this one with so little content",3
95344,To much disconnect between assignments and lectures,3
95366,assignment is a little bit messy.,3
95394,Top free course about Data Science. But I think lectures must be more detailed and related to assignments. And assignments could be less ambiguous and more clear.,3

95432,"This course is a decent introduction to using the python pandas data science package, but suffers from some problems.The lectures are very brief and do not prepare you well for the assignments. The assignments are not well described and the autograder is very finicky. As a result, every week I spent several hours on the fora and stackoverflow to figure out what the autograder wants, instead of actually learning pandas. I managed to pass this course with (what I know is) subpar code, but we never get to see proper solutions to the assignments.The course has potential, but as it is now, I will continue this specialisation.",3
95433,"The instructor is warm and seems pretty interested.Content is way too minimal though and it's not enough to prepare the student for the assessments.A lot of searching is required in order to arrive at the solution which more often than not is not the most optimum one. Forums are only supported by fellow students and staff's involvement is next to zero in there. Even threads that deal with clarifying questions were not answered by the staff.I understand that this way enforces community building and helping fellow students, but staff's participation would be highly appreciated.",3
95450,"A course which has great assignments. However, the video itself is a bit boring. Most of the time, my motivation to learn this course is just doing its assignments.At the same time, the assignments are somewhat difficult for those who are not familiar with Python, but for me it's just OK. What I want to make complaints about the assignments is that sometimes the Autograder is so rigid that I have to try one question over and over again until the Autograder ""feels happy"", and for me, sometimes the gap between ""correct answer"" and ""incorrect answer"" isn't so large...And finally, thank you, teacher Christopher Brooks! You are ateacher full of passion, and I actually learnt a lot from you and your course.",3
95451,"Lectures were interesting and well put together, however the assignments and the knowledge required for the assignments were not covered in the lecture material. While I can appreciate that every course will require some elements of self-learning and exploration, this felt a step too far. My sense is that if you have some experience in the actual topics covered by the course, and are looking to verify your knowledge with a certificate, you will be fine. However if you are hoping to actually learn about the topics, you are going to have to work very hard. I'm hoping that the coverage of course material to assignment requirements is a lot better in the subsequent courses in this specialization.",3
95461,"I have two general comments:The first comment is . . . there was too wide a gap between the lecture content and the assignments. The second comment I have is . . . I spent too much time trying to figure out what the autograder wanted and not enough time learning Data Science with Python. I can only imagine the work that it takes to develop and launch a course like this. In all, I'm very excited to be part of this program. My comments are critical but hopefully helpful and all your work is appreciated.",3
95468,"The course is interesting, but the grading system needs to improve substantially. The grader bugs considerably, and the questions are often not well defined, which requires a lot of unnecessary trial and error to understand what exactly the question was about. Finally, complete the assignments took way long that what it is suggested.",3
95470,The assignments were good but it was a lot of time spent with the grader.,3
95482,"The content and assignments are certainly useful and relevant. However, the lectures are too short and do not help much with doing the assignment. As a beginner, I relied heavily on google and the discussion forum to get through the assignment. And I am not sure if i can actually tackle similar problems again without referring back to the pre-mentioned resources.",3
95484,"More concise coding tutorials and less ""search on your own on the internet"" needed. It is great to get to know the online community and the course needs more coding example directly relat to exams.",3
95500,Contents are great and very relative. Exam is fair and reasonable. However students have to deal with an autograder for the scores and the autograder is not up to par for this course. The amount of time that you spend on learning during the course is only a fraction of time you spend to get through the autograder.,3
95501,"The course was challenging, and although I would have liked a bit more information from the video lectures, and a bit more practice on using the basic functions, I learned a lot.I thought the video lectures were a little sparse. There were only 20-30 minutes worth of video lectures per week and the assignments required you to stretch the knowledge that you gained from the lecture videos quite a bit.More examples in video lectures would have helped. I would have also liked to see a few simple problems in each assignments just to get comfortable using the various functions introduced in the lecture.So overall, the course was challenging and definitely a fair amount of work coming from someone new to python (but moderately experienced in C programming), and although I would have liked a bit more guidance, I learned a lot.",3
95503,"A good introduction to python and data science. The questions were just about the right level of difficulty. My main criticism is that the online videos were pretty short and not going into a lot of detail, whereas with the questions you had to do a lot of extra research to figure out how to solve them. More interaction with the enrolled students during the course and having more in-depth videos would make the course a lot better.",3
95509,The course is very interesting. The Jupiter notebook is very useful.I don't like that many examples are very US-specific. Some important terms may not be clear for people who live outside USA.Update: I'm lowering my grade from 4 stars to 3 stars because of very confusing assignments. Often it's not clear the requirement of the task. It takes very long to understand. Also some assignments require methods and functions that were not covered in video lectures.,3
95528,"This course would feel very basic to anyone who has studied sustainable development or sustainable business in any form. It may complement what you've already learnt by articulating the concepts well, but the lecture videos felt redundant after reading material for Week 1. This course can be improved by adding a few in-depth case studies to the weekly assignments.",3
95550,This is a pretty basic course. It teaches you three tools to organize your work and home to-do lists. I do not think I will use the system that was taught.,3
95553,"Helpful, but the teacher is annoying and condesending.",3
95572,"Calling this a course is a stretch.It would even be a stretch to call it a workshop. Course material is thin and you can go through it in a couple of hours. If you squeeze the content, you can probably get a couple of pages of notes out of it.Having said that, it is somehow useful, if you don't already have a system in place that works for you. I would only recommend this course to someone with a serious personal management issue.",3
95734,"Great video, they should be longer and more detailed though.Some of the information about these topics were treated in a more detailed and useful way in the introductory course",3
95739,In general it's really fun here but the assignments takes much more time than told and i wishedthe focus would be more on layouting interfaces.,3
95759,"For some of the topics, the Introduction class has more meaningful homework projects. this felt a bit thin.",3
95761,"This was a kind of basic course without enough examples. That being said, the most interesting part of the course is prototyping section. I am looking forward to hearing more about that aspect of design.",3
95794,The lectures were somehow chaotic.,3
95799,"With a biology background I had some difficulty following this course. That is understandable, as a lot of it relies in mathematical modelling and statistics. I still felt like some exam questions relied on material not yet lectured, which would sometimes leave me at a loss as to how I should have gotten to the right question in the first place. The lectures could have been structured differently, so as to facilitate engagement - I found myself easily losing focus and having to repeat the videos. Despite its shortcomings, the course is still a powerful introduction to Systems Biology.",3
95811,"I'm new to Business Strategy, with previous background in Engineering. The course seriously lacks notes and proper definitions of the concepts. You will have to do your own research to understand the definitions. Also, you are expected to review 3 other projects. When you are a student yourself, how can you be expected to fairly grade your peers? I'm really not sure how useful this is going to be towards actually using it. I mean, will an employer find this useful? I don't know.",3
95860,"I think that the information for the assignments must be more clear, templates for the tasks needs revision.",3
95873,Having successfully completed 'Getting Started: Agile Meets Design Thinking' I found this module partially confusing. It is also based on Alex Cowans' venture design process but this time on each step you do things that differ from what was taught in the previous course. Things seem to be complementary but you should not expect to go through a structured process over all courses. They are all based on the same process but shed light on different aspects.I also have the imporession that the didactics of this second course still coudl be improved a lot. Quizzes are currently reworked and bugs fixed and the team is very responsive.It still was a good learning experience and doing Design sprints is a great approach. From the review of assignments I can say that a few students seem to adapt better to the structure of the course that I did. But most seemed to be equally if not more confused. Doing reviews wasn't fun because formally most students got enough points but content-wise I perceived it as rather messy assignments to review. :/,3
95887,Just read PPT,3
95959,it's ok,3
95962,This course is understanding water and sanitation through the lens of economics. Lacked water and sanitation element through infectious disease (biological lens). I guess that is why its water supply and sanitation POLICY.,3
95971,"The course gave a nice overview on strategy formulation but was in my view a bit inconsistent. However I learned the main techniques used in formulation, so no regrets.",3
95978,I wish teachers look at our work too rather than student though they do their jobs.,3
95986,"I felt the course was ok, but wanted more. It seemed very general, even with the focus in the end on e-Types.",3
95987,I think the level was a bit on the low side and the time i had to spend on each week was far less compared with the first module. Videos maintain high standard.,3
95996,"This course was more diverse than I thought it would be and I really enjoyed it, however I thought the end of year project could have provided more differentiated prep material as that confused me.",3
96002,"The course content itself was good, however the final assignment was vague and confusing. I think my coursemates had the same problem; all of the submissions I reviewed failed to discuss in any way at least one of the learning objectives.",3
96005,Not too much different information from what can be found in internet for free.If it was cheaper the relationship cost-quality could improve.,3
96013,The materials were interesting and relevant. The instructions for the final project were a bit cryptic - it was not completely clear what the instructor wanted. The submissions I reviewed were all over the board and none came close to the grading rubric,3
96023,Could be improved.. the ideas seem disconnected there is no clear flow of the ideas presented in different weeks and the specific actions to formulate a strategy. but overall good course with excellent frameworks. Thanks a lot Coursera,3
96026,Too few students.,3
96036,Interesting but not really practical. This module could benefit of more examples when it comes to formulating strategies.,3
96048,"A good, basic introduction to Social Media Data Analytics",3
96051,"Good overview, could be more robust and thorough!",3
96053,It can be more exhaustive..,3
96125,good course all basics,3
96149,it was a good course.but it was super boring as hellthat's why I didn't continue learning the other modulesmost of coursera's courses as boring but this was the most boring,3
96151,"The assignment instructions weren't clear and when uploading the assignment files, the pages didn't render properly. This also was a problem during peer review of assignments.",3
96199,"Pretty decent breakdown of Bootstrap, but execution can be poor with the assignments. For example, one of the end-chapter assignments is missing complete instructions, and enough digging in the forums refers to, ""a screenshot of the complete instructions"". Rather unacceptable for a peer-reviewed course, okay for a free, self-auditing run.",3
96212,"I think this course was way too ambitious. It's neat to imagine learning all of this stuff in four weeks, but one should be realistic. Sure, we had lectures explaining things, but in the end we mostly had to copy-and-paste code and confirm that it worked. There should have been many, many more quizzes and short coding exercises to assess our understanding.Perhaps billing this with more content hours would be appropriate. To really understand and absorb this stuff, I'll need to spend a lot of time with the ""additional resources"". The lectures and scaffolded exercises certainly exposed us to a lot, but it would be hard to say I really learned very much.",3
96213,Very basic course. It's not worth it 70$,3
96235,The sound doesn't turn up very loud.,3
96241,"Course content is good, however instructions for the assignments are not complete. Often, instructions for the assignments that are required in the grading criteria are buried in the discussion forums, sometimes in multiple threads. And the method of grading is also only explained in the discussion forum. This can lead to the peer review grades being difficult to assign. The assignment pages should be updated to properly include ALL requirements and an explanation of how to grade the assignment.",3
96264,"Excellent for absolute beginners! But, if you have good experience in CSS & JavaScript you might play it at 1.5X, it is too informative to be attended by someone who knows even a little, it might be boring, then.Generally, the course is very informative, rich, instructions based and have very good exercises covering all the course content with a good-as-a-start hands on experience.",3
96283,"As a beginner, this cours is greate",3
96288,Good basic course,3
96292,"I think the classes and the exercises could be far more dynamic and didactic, but besides of that is a good course to get a grip of Bootstrap if you follow along writing the code and if you tinker a little by yourself afterwards. But it's definitely for people with solid JS and CSS bases.",3
96303,It's a good course where I come across bower and CSS how to use the function for the UI frameworks.,3
96339,"Valuable and very well organized, I found it quite simple",3
96345,"The topic is overall well covered.The material are not easy to go through and do not reference well key knowledge area, specifically: how to apply them.The exercises and the assignments could be largely improved: the targets and the guidance are not always clear. Adding up on the same files instead having one file per exercice / one learning key point does not help.",3
96367,This was a four star course and the links to additional information were a good resource. 3 stars for the discussions which were left unanswered much of the time and not a highly active mentor group. Much was left to student when stuck and exasperated options.,3
96384,"The course is good. I already use Bootstrap and still finding useful information here. But the sound is too silent. Also teacher speaks too slow, it makes listening even more difficult.",3
96415,Would have like it more if JQUERY section was covered in more depth covering more examples and features.,3
96446,"jogesh mupalla should be more descriptive about his explanation, he should explain if not all then most of the components of the bootstrap coding , which he sometimes skips or misses, otherwise the course is good",3
96545,could be better,3
96592,It‘s very difficult to listen what the teacher say. The teacher is not good for expression.感觉老师表达能力有所欠缺，听起来很吃力，说话语速很不流畅，应该要好好改进一下。真想退款了,3
96616,It would be better if the assignments were not guided so straight forward.,3
96687,"Good coverage of bootstrap, but the other parts were very briefly touched upon (nodejs, bower etc.)",3
96693,"I wish, the professor could pay more attention to from questions from students.",3
96739,"Although the course structure and information is great, the course exercise and grading organization has a lot of space for improvement. Current structure doesn't make it possible for the learner to determine the speed. All the parts are equally important. You have to carefully go through hours of instructions.Each week and the assignment builds on what you have done before, but there are no checkpoints where you can verify your code matches the actual expectations. This causes a lot of confusion.Peer evaluation rules are not shown before you submit your work. After submitting my work, I discovered that there are requirements that were not in the assignment.",3
96776,thank you profecsor,3
96779,the course contents are great and understandable but I have a problem with the lake of details information the instructor sometimes forget to provide..,3
96784,"It is interesting in the first weeks and at the time I did it I was living in a country that would qualify as subsistence marketplace so could see directly what was explained.However, felt it was a little rushed, repetitive and not very detailed or clear when it came to creating a business plan.",3
96827,"The contents of the course are definitely insightful and approrpriately based on scientific research. Dr. Greg Urban is extremely knowleadgeable on the topic.The reason why I am not giving the course a higher rate is because: 1) I find the pace of the course is quite slow, 2) the inactivity in the discussion forums and the lack of peer reviews in the assignments reduces its interactivity and 3) both the contents and grading system are very theoretical.Still, I would recommend this course as it provides a solid foundation on the principles behind the dynamics of culture.",3
96839,Peer review is not best way to grade if requires some form of subjective judgement from people that maybe are not the very qualified to provide it.,3
96840,"This class had a lot of good material and it truly showed how powerful GIS is in analysis. My recommendation would be for this class to be broken into two sessions to really practice everything that was taught in the videos. However, I plan on doing this on my own through the GIS help boxes before I take the 4th class.",3
96930,"At first I though it was a very poor course but certain parts of it were gold for me and I got a lot out of it. I particularly appreciated the advice on how to improvise through out the course. I was less keen on the parts on modes and pentatonics but on the other hand for someone further along in their musical journey it may be just the thing. Although the course is ostensibly on the blues it also covers a lot of material relevant to Jazz.Pedagogically there were some problems.I think the course has way too much material and could be split into 2 parts each part maybe a bit slower.The presenter need to sharpen up his game a little as regards presentation skills, reading material of an IPad is not very inspiring. His English is not very idiomatic but that's not really a big problem. Written sheets with the changes and summarizing the lectures would have made the course better. Finally there are no peer reviews and all quizzes are theoretical - rather disappointing. I prefer a hands on approach with peer based reviews as in Gary Burton's course also on Coursera.",3
96933,"Five stars for the excellent teachers and content, but the course is not made for Coursera: very long videos, slides full of words, many references to the group work for the course at JHU, tiny quizzes and just two practical assignments. The format and the examinations can be definitely improved.",3
96952,"Great content, but not delivered in a very dynamic manner so hard to stay attentive.",3
96976,A good course that lacked practical information on performing a meta-analysis.,3
97049,It was an amazing experience,3
97058,"This was a good introduction that bought in some new and previously visited concepts. I did find the course a little 'bitty' compared to other courses I have completed through Coursera, and the assignments were not very clearly structured.That said I would recommend it to anyone looking for a solid introduction to this area.",3
97072,"It´s very focus on primary teaching which is good, but maybe there is a bit too much of theory, I was expecting a bit more of practical resources about how to face a classroom. Good course anyway!",3
97086,The instructions for writing the essays were confusing. The content was also a bit scattered. It was a little bit dto summize the main points of each lesson.,3
97185,not comprehensive enough,3
97187,useful but boring!,3
97225,"Very helpful for people who are new to the field. However, I do wish many of the concepts were explained more clearly; often new concepts are introduced and no clear definition is given.",3
97236,"One of the things that I didn't like is that I couldn't complete the course because, without purchasing the course, I didn't have access to the assignments / quizzes. But the content is good and the Geneva teachers are nice (specially Michel!). Also, some USB guest lectures are not adequate for this type of course, which is for beginners. Sometimes the guest lectures are not even related to the content of the modules where they are presented.",3
97239,"Great subjects and some great teachers. But every now and then I missed some proper explanations.Further, reverences to articles and books to better understand the subjects were missing as well.",3
97240,"Some very good explanations, especially by Michel Girardin. Some other courses lack explanations.",3
97242,"I learn some interesting things. The course gets better for week 3-4. However, the course could use better the Coursera format and strenght.The certified certificate is pricy compared to other courses.In overall it’s good.",3
97243,The course is comprehensive and the instructors have good teaching skills.The level is introductory.I would recommend this course to beginners with limited previous exposure to investment management.,3
97247,"Good basic understanding. However the professors can be a bit more professional, sometimes it feels like Im a high school student again, the way they explain things.",3
97255,The course is fine but the obligation to pay for reviewing quizzies is a mistake if the course expects to get good valuations (in stars) and promotion. There are similar or even better content available in other courses which are truly open and that request for payment if the student wish to get the certificate.Wrong positioning of University of Genève offering this MOOC from an economical point of view. They ask for more than others and will get less.,3
97258,"A little too theoretical and the subjects are not easy to follow.It should have more step by step and deep explanation (math stuff).The interest rates vs bonds are difficult for begginers, it should be transmitted in different ways.",3
97263,"just a normal online course, the instructors are just reciting their ppt and prepared materials. Pretty boring.",3
97276,Difficulties streaming,3
97341,Very Useful,3
97390,"this course is a decent introduction and overview from a sociological perspective, of the city. It is well structured, progresses quickly, and begins to contrast the sociological analysis with contemporary theory and critical approaches.",3
97391,"Topic and approach are interesting, however the disturbingly-modulated voice and exaggerated accent of the professor can get a bit unbearable at times and make lectures arduous to follow and enjoy.",3
97400,Not so practical,3
97405,"I feel like there's so much content in this course, but I didn't really learn anything...It's a lot of talking, ending with ""go to the forums and ask your peers about all these concepts that you need to know but that I won't talk about.""",3
97465,"Strategic implementation, something that people generally forget about after creating their ""marvellous"" strategies and then watch them fail. This course teaches us how not to make that mistake.The course was nicely organised, though I believe the rubric for the last peer review assignment could do with a bit of tweaking. Rating on a 1-5 scale for about 10 questions clearly showed central tendency problems, as well as lots of subjectivity in the reviews. I hope it can be improved in the future!",3
97475,"Material was very good and well structured.I think that one main issue is the assignment. We would need much more info/hard facts to make it much more interesting (i.e. less theoritical).Moreover, assignments are reviewed by people 1/ who did not necessarily went through the 2 previous courses 2/ did not see our previous documents ie for course 1 and 2 3/ did not necessarily understand the question (one person complained because I did not answer the question ""edgy vs. conservative"" => I guess she was misled by the support info which were the same as for the first course).This problem could be avoided by offering a distinct case for each assignment, so that there is no confusion/mis-match.In any case, ""mange tak"" for all your courses. I went through 3 so far, and the ones from CBS are clearly the best I had (videos - content and speed - slides/ support documents, quizzes).",3
97483,"Shame that the format was changed and the quizzes and assignments were not open. Teaching was as great as the first 2 courses, and slides were useful.",3
97498,"Interesting and informative, but the material seemed dated. The paper on Jihadi terrorists in Europe is from 2006, and information from the global terrorism database is from 2010, for example. Some of the lecture content also seemed years behind the times -- like the omission of any mention of the increase in terrorist attacks in Western Europe. (Yes, the lecture on foreign fighters was more current.)Maybe it's there somewhere, but all MOOCs should disclose when the lectures were recorded.",3
97515,An interesting course. Could do with a bit of a technical overhaul as it feels a little clunky in terms of access to course materials and technical structure. Overall well presented and excellent content.,3
97563,"In general good, but not updated - seems from around 2013, so the new developments are not mentioned.",3
97564,Good review of the theory but course is outdated given the number of events in the last 2 years that relate to the information provided in the course -- particularly as it relates to attacks,3
97586,Theoretically the course is very lacking. There is little focus on the scholarly work in the field except perhaps the first few lectures. The content and scope of the course is too small. Overall however the content is good for a very basic introduction and,3
97588,Altogether a useful introduction to an interesting topic -- despite the generalizing approach and the sometimes conservative instead of neutral presentation.,3
97589,Not updated data,3
97600,Average. Doesn't really like the Professor's style. He spends too many time trying to explain that he feels really concern about the victims etc. I feel that the content of the class could have been interesting but the organization was messy. Finally it gives the impression that academics know barely anything about the subject. I would have prefer a more historical approach. Overall i've watched all the content but in the future i won't spend much time checking for new Mooc from him. Thanks for the try though,3
97684,It was very good to learn terrorism from the theory angle and believe the two groups should work closer.,3
97704,"It is a great theme, but at many points the course focuses on ""who said what"", regarding authors and papers, and emphasizes this type of question throughout all the tests. I think a longer course where these statements and papers could be properly discussed and explained would easily be a 5-star rating. The instructor clearly knows a lot on the subject and the material is top quality.",3
97730,A bit too basic,3
97734,"I liked the course very much, but it is brief. I think it will help us more if some topics are explained in detail.",3
97742,Some presentations are too kitch.,3
97754,very useful and well designed,3
97770,"I feel like the topic of technology is important, but important enough for a full course. I also feel more class management strategies for ESL classroom would have been a more valuable topic.",3
97791,"Appreciate this course a lot, it was crisp and to the point. Major focus was on using Design Thinking tool.The only downside was the lack of reference material. Course should include the slides that were presented in the video as well as some additional reading material (available for free)",3
97803,"This course provides a good understanding of the DT steps with concrete application examples. However, it requires additional readings to be able to apply this learning",3
97819,"Interesting course, but the evaluation process should be reworked with weekly quizz to ensure that the main concepts have been understood and a different final exam which does not assume that you already had the opportunity to apply and reflect upon what you have learned",3
97838,The course is made for managers who want to get on the innovation wagon.,3
97846,"The content is very interesting and I learned a lot about Design Thinking. However, the lecturer sounds like she's reading the text, which sometimes makes it hard to focus on what she's saying.",3
97880,"Could be less generic! The exemples are a little bit abstract, not much hands on or practical.",3
97883,I would appreciate more practical cases with the detailed methodology that were applied. Also I will love external resources to study and examples of design thinking applied in different types of industries,3
97890,"The course videos are well made and insightful. Except for the very end there are no quizzes and assignments. This misses out what for me is a vital part of the learning experience, regular feedback and reflection.",3
97900,This course starts quite well but it´s awful at finish,3
97903,"I audited this course. The videos are in fact useful. However, it would appear that the real interaction is reserved for the later weeks of the course. Thus moving from theory to application can be a bit abstract. Of course I did purchase the book and workbook created by the author and have found them to have additional material to support application.",3
97956,"Content is fairly good with weak story line and connection across the various modules. Also the lack of in session quiz modules or weekly quiz module to re-inforce learning is disappointing.It's also possible that i was expecting a lot from a course on design thinking and what it turned out to be was just a scratching of the surface of what the definition of Design Thinking is all about. Having read numerous books on Lean Thinking, Agile development, Minimum Viable Propositions, etc. I was really expecting a solid rigorous approach to the world of design thinking.This course let me down and I just managed to scrape through at the end...almost gave up.",3
97970,"Great materials, great learning system! I could get some inspiration and learning, but i thought it was to short.",3
97972,A very well-done introduction to Design Thinking,3
97998,"I previously gave this course a 5-star review; however, upon realising that there is no way to access the classroom after receiving the final grade and certificate, I simply can't give it the same excellent review. I have no way of accessing discussions and my final assignment to see any feedback classmates have given. There is also no option to re-take the final assignment, which was peer-graded and I believe I was not properly evaluated by my peers.",3
98009,"The course is pretty uneventful. I have done some courses from other universities, which are more interactive and fun. But the content is great!",3
98066,"The course is very complete on it's subjects and points, but should have more slides and some times be more grafic about some examples, this makes the lessons boring and harder to follow because there is a massive amount of informations. Also have too much questions on the quizzes.",3
98126,"Interessant, but it wasn't organized too well. Some questions referred to topics which came in the next lesson",3
98127,"Too much theories ,I hope the professor add more programming assignment.",3
98130,"The course was great. What I had a real problem with was the lack of response for problems with the Honors programming assignments. I never received any feedback from the TA's and when I submitted to MeTa support, they said the school design the programs so they can't help. I got a Segmentation Fault on Assignment one which I never did get resolved. Because of this, I was unable to get the Honors status.",3
98132,excellent material and great explanations! The main problem here is that quizzes will sometimes cover subjects not introduced until the following week.,3
98136,Ok. It was a rerun and there wasn't much help in the Forum and there were too few exercises. But it was really interesting.,3
98150,"Very theoretical and somewhat dry. If you are interested in applied machine learning techniques (for text retrieval and analysis) this is not really the course to take. Gives a solid background though which, in my opinion, every aspiring data analyst needs.",3
98162,I definitely would recommend more essential books and maybe TED Talks as well.Great books on communication were written by William UryGetting to YesGetting to Yes with yourself (essential book)Beyond Reasonhttps://www.amazon.de/Getting-Yes-Yourself-Worthy-Opponents/dp/0062390678/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid=1479132707&sr=8-6&keywords=William+ury,3
98174,"Very basic, decent information.",3
98188,"Great course, but sometime it is boring since the introductor just read materials. Hope this can be improved in the future.",3
98203,Feel too short.,3
98204,Effective but could be more detailed.,3
98208,Informative but not ideal for anyone not going into business.,3
98209,"The contents are OK, but the unity packages for the course are unaccessible(download speed is about 8kb/s and stops at 30MB, never able to download). Have left comments in the forum, but no one has replied.",3
98220,"Interesting, and helpful.",3
98259,"Good theoretical knowledge. The program create awareness about Marketing analytics, The program could be improved with more detailed examples across different industry. It would be logical to have a part 2 where theory is applied for practical learning.",3
98264,Very good information a little confusion with the regression it's like doing algebra but I like the course.,3
98287,It has great content.A good investment of your time.,3
98292,Not bad by the now,3
98306,"Quite informative about project decision criteria, gathering capital for firm, about mergers and acquisition and at last about risk management.",3
98313,"This course provides a good overview about virtual instruction and online learning for those who are looking to transition from classroom teaching. The topics are broken down into manageable chunks and a few interviews with other people help to add interest. However, when I wanted to go back and reread for clarification, I found the transcript to be poorly edited and at times almost unintelligible. As an example: iNACOL (National Association for Online and Blended Learning) is referred to many times in the video lectures and was transcribed in the text in a number of different ways: ""Ian Nicole"", ""Inacles"" and ""iNickel."" I really wish the people who put this course together has taken the time to read and edit the transcripts of the video lectures. Many sentences were written without punctuation or contained misspelled words. (enrollment was spelled enrolment) Often I just wanted to read it the lecture, not hear the instructor's voice but found the written text to be less than clear. I also wish there had been a way to ask questions regarding the material, but unfortunately, there was not, not that I could find. Finally, some of the questions on the final quiz are confusing. For example, question #5 "" Which two of the following..."" and then in parentheses it says to check all that apply. I hope this feedback helps to point out some of the problems that hinder virtual instruction.",3
98318,"This is a good course for learning about the reasons, rules and methods of virtual instruction but I think some more interactivity and an increase in the number of in video quizzes would help. I also think more screen shots and a greater number of screen changes would improve the experience.",3
98320,"All in all I liked the course, it's easy to comprehend and well structured. Nevertheless, I missed the lecurer, I'd really liked that the lectured didn't read the script but retold it in the camera, it would be more of a face to face communication. Besides, some interviews would be nice.",3
98323,"This was a good course, a little hard to follow at times but very beneficial.",3
98331,The videos talk about forums but there is no forum. It leaves the impression that the course was designed and then abandoned.,3
98342,"If the lecture had been in English, it would have been a lot more understandable. I had to read the subtitles to understand. It was quite good.",3
98346,"Some sections were rather basic, lacking insight on some topics. It may be suitable for people with incipient engineering knowledge but for the slightly trained a bit repetitive. Still, the lectures were quite entertaining and the approach taken remarkable didactic.",3
98351,"A nice course for beginners that include basics of communication, satellite segments and services. Please include slides when the course reruns in future and additional study resources for better understanding of concepts.",3
98358,"I really enjoyed weeks 1 and 2. They were more business focused. Weeks 3 through 6 were super technical. All in all, it was a great primer for satellite communications. Congrats to the team!",3
98376,Longer than it should be,3
98415,"While the content and the curriculum of the course is ok, the course is not moderated enough in terms of answering the questions the participants have",3
98436,"It was very dificul, i think yoou need to improve the example you give the the students and be more interactive",3
98438,The instruction from the first three weeks does not sufficiently prepare me for the final project.,3
98447,One must have some R knowledge prior to take this course. I would recommend to take the other R programming course from the Data Science track before.,3
98450,"I feel that the training could be more extensive prior to assignments. The assignments often cause me to randomly search packages for correct functions to use and how to apply proper syntax, etc.",3
98456,The instructors did nothing. They did not even respond to a single question through the entirety of the course. The information in the readings was helpful though.,3
98487,I found the video lectures less helpful with this course (than the quantitative course) and resorted to reading the transcripts in order to learn the important information. I did enjoy the assignments ( observation and interview processes) and found the application helped better understand the theory.,3
98502,I found this course very useful and would recommend it to friends if they are interested,3
98555,"Good, but it lacks proper materials to come back to - slides are very heavy and not clear and transcript is missing connections to slides.",3
98557,Very convoluted; examples not so clear; still interesting and well produced.,3
98612,"It is a great course, however some practical examples to try would benefit users",3
98613,The information is reviewed quickly through the lectures series and it would have been helpful to have some practice scenarios before taking the quiz. It's more helpful to review different spreadsheet layouts to familiarize how variables are organized.,3
98616,"Some modules are better than others. There is a strong emphasis in accounting rather than modelling, which was not what I was looking for.",3
98622,"This course was okay. It could be improved by incorporating some concepts and principles of a previous course, ""Modeling Risk and Realities"".",3
98624,This course has felt irrelevant in comparison to some of the other courses in this specialisation and this has a very narrow focus which doesn't help. Not all of us are accountants.,3
98645,A bit less engaging than the other parts of the Executive Data Science course.,3
98649,It was quite hard with all the statistical jargon. Too much theory.,3
98662,Much theorical with few examples. Could incorporate examples outside the health world as well.,3
98667,It's sometimes difficult to follow professors beacuse they take for granted information about the examples they use that is not evident for the learners. They should take a minute to explain a little bit more what the examples consist of and what are the charts they show. As it happens when Brian Caffo explains the blocking adjustments part.,3
98669,"I missed several concepts to better understand some of the discussions and explanations. It was valid, but I think the statistics background should be better explored.",3
98670,"Some good tips, nothing terribly new for those who have had a course in statistics. Materials made easy to digest. The variety from the 3 instructors was nice. Missed opportunity: to combine the best aspects from each. The course notes were either excerpts from R.Peng's books /blogs (good) or automated transcripts (complete with typical AI typos... ""wait"" instead of ""weight""). Some lectures were repetitive from one course to another. Slides with examples were useful, slides with clip-art and comic stips less so. Tries to be something for everyone. Would be better to aim either at former DS analysts aspiring to be managers or seasoned managers trying to better understand DS.",3
98679,"Brian tries to achieve too much in too little time. It addresses important issues and it gives a good overview, including some hidden gems (Machine Learning vs Stats, for example), but it feels mostly too rushed and superficial for my taste/expectations, and it fails to connect to my previous knowledge (and I have a PhD in Maths, although no strong Stats background), hence little added value for me when I cannot relate to what is being discussed.",3
98690,"Relevant materials, but lecture delivery is rather dry,",3
98705,"Brian, Jeff, and Roger: Thank you very much for all the data science courses, really great. I generally rate them 5 stars. But for this one, I'm giving 3 stars, not because the content is not good (it is; it provides good practical and experiential information), but rather because the material seems repetitive at times either within the same course or with topics in the other courses. Also, the sequencing and lectures seem sometime a bit disjointed.May I humbly suggest an idea: Integrate the key points of this course relating to real-world examples and the sharing of real-world experiences into one of the other courses.Thank you.Robert Al-Jaar, PhDrobert.aljaar@rassociates.biz",3
98707,"Too short, too expensive.",3
98710,"Lectures themselves were OK, but presentation needs work. Intro session was very repetitive. Lot of jargon introduced without explanation. Pop-ups w text showed up but disappeared before I was able to finish reading them. Best part of course was actually the text notes at the beginning of each sesssion. A minor nitpick: course description suggests that there are 3 instructors presenting, but I only saw one.",3
98711,"The video quality and content were good. Unfortunately, there were a lot of spelling errors and grammatical mistakes in the written portions.",3
98727,"The information presented was interesting, and the instructors were engaging. However, I had major issues with the translation. It was completely literal, and often translated in ways that did not make sense. If I did not have a working knowledge of academic French, I would have been lost. Also, many of the test questions were unclear and did not follow best practices in test taking.",3
98739,"Very interesting course, providing a descent overview of the whole water management and policy question. A lot of interesting examples are provided to illustrate the different points and various experts are interviewed throughout the course. I still believe though that the general message remains very generic and would benefit from further technical details to go more in depth. Also, the English subtitles do not always exactly match the oral French version.Finally, the marking only based on quizzes that can be retaken several times makes it very easy in my view. I believe that assignments that would require more involvement from the students (e.g. maybe group assignments with other students?) or applications of the course concepts to case studies would greatly enhance the quality of the course.Still, it remains a very interesting and well dispensed course!",3
98751,"Since I'm working on water modelling (computational fluid dynamics, programming shallow water simulations), I thought it would be fun to learn more about the political side. However, this course has very little in-depth information (pun not intended) and I would like to know more about the actual tools used to design water policies. Though the course is most likely too easy for most university students, it is also very abstract and I would have liked having to do a little more thinking on the real-world examples myself.",3
98754,"So first of all, the material for this course in the bookdown document are very good - well structured, with good sources. My concern is that the Coursera course does not go a lot beyond, basically just referring to the document and adding quizzes + graded assignment in the last week. The assignment, however, is nice and challenging and requires people to understand the materials.Also, the course covers other great packages than ggplot2, e.g. plotly and leaflet and methods for handling spatial data. I think it would be very nice if the students were challenged in these topics as well and evaluate them in a better way than just a quiz (programming assignment for instance).I liked the course though and I believe it can be prepared even better.",3
98770,Its good to get started with server side development with node.,3
98806,"Great introductory course, however, there are some anti-patterns taught (e.g. mongodb unbounded arrays). Also, there is no testing frameworks used - and this is a big missing element for modern careers in web development.",3
98814,"It provides good resources and code, but if you get stuck, there's no help. By the time one gets this far the participation has plummeted and there's no mentors or instructor help. Very frustrating to get this far only to be stopped because you're on your very own.",3
98844,Super basic! The instructor goes super slowly and spends a lot of time on unnecessary stuff. Each video can be down in half the time,3
98858,"Great contents as the rest of the courses in the specialization. I'm afraid I need to be a little bit critical with this one though:1) The contents are really jammed into 4 weeks - The last week's contents are actually some kind of miscellany between mongoose, https, authentication and BaaS2) Not a single quiz or self-evaluation of sorts along the course - To be completely fair, the exercises shown along the way might make up for it. Still, I think it's important to spread some quizes around so as to make absorb the concepts more effectively3) The quality of the presentations is somewhat lower than other courses. There's even a video towards the end of the course where a Linkedin notification springs up on top, which even makes the presenter pause for a few seconds.Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed this course and definitely appreciate the effort put into it - Given the newly introduced Coursera fees, I'd expect much more quality in place to make it 70 buck-worth, though",3
98875,"I don't like the fact you have to pay 80 dollars just to unlock assignment submissions. The fact that other students have to grade each other is not worth the 80 dollars. Think of all the students that may attend the course will more than cover the server costs if it was 10$. Otherwise, the class so far is useful.",3
98889,Not a very good course. The assignments are not very clear. Could have done much more like integrating front-end etc in place of that loopback module. Was really disappointed with this one. Should have given 0 stars but gave 3 stars for Jogesh Muppala as he is my favourite teacher when it comes to MOOC,3
98962,The assignments took me much longer than the suggested 3 hours. Every task depends on having completed the previous task perfectly. My assignment in week 4 passed the end to end test perfectly on my local computer but failed the grader. I traced the problem back to a tiny typo that I made in week 2 assignment. (My heart sank when I saw I had to reuse my week 2 work in week 4 as I knew how much messing around I had done to get that one through the grader - I knew it would give problems)As there were a couple of mistakes in the course (for example if you follow the steps in assignment 3 correctly then the final rspec would give failures - obviously this wasn't picked up by lecturers) it creates confusion and doubt as to whether you have made the mistake or the tutors.The course content is good but the assignments need to be shorter and more forgiving of mistakes (i.e make the individual tasks independent of one another and pass if you get 80%). I am not sure if I will continue with the specialisation right now. It seems more suited to someone who is studying full time and not someone who is working who has limited spare time.,3
98988,"Great course although I did struggle through the very last assignment. The first three were relatively ok, considering I'm new at this but they did take me longer than 3 hours to complete. The last one took about 3 days!That being said, if the rspec tests weren't being run in dev mode, it might have been quicker. I had to move ""ENV['RAILS_ENV'] ||= 'test'"" from rails_helper.rb to spec_helper.rb to get stuff working.Without my ruby on rails hubby, I'd have been lost!",3
99025,Good homework and good examples.,3
99051,"I had initially started the course in order to gain insight more into the role of wind energy, the operations, the components and financing behind it. The course was a little heavy on actual mechanics and turbine output calculations. Would've enjoyed a more descriptive course with more emphasis on the financing and operational side as well as how the wind facilities fit into the grid. That said, it does provide a great basic overview of the concept and the mathematical side is still useful, particularly if interested in the engineering aspect.",3
99106,"The course is well structured, and the contents are exposed clearly. Probably one of the main problems of the subject ""Wind Energy"" itself, is it covers many disciplines (Aerodynamics, Mechanics and Machinery, Structural design, Electricity and Grid connection, Financial aspects...), so a 5-Week course had to be quite superficial to cover each of this aspects minimally. For my expectations it was a little bit too simple, but mostly the quizzes were too easy. The hints after the quizz questions were solving the questions and avoiding the beautiful part of the quizzes: playing with the formulae, and interiorizing it.All in all it was a nice, enjoyable course, but sadly I feel I didn't get deep enough in many of the treated subjects, even for an introductory course.",3
99121,Overall informative. Some parts of the lecture was confusing for beginners. The voice needs to be a little louder.,3
99126,Needs improvement a lot I think.,3
99155,"Good course but a little more detail with better referencing to links and documents would be more helpful. Also, a little more in-depth info for each topic will also be well appreciated. Overall a good course for beginners like me who knew nothing about Wind Energy before taking this course.",3
99165,"It's globally a nice course, although you have to keep in mind that it is more like an introduction to the topic rather than a real, full course. I was quite frustrated from time to time that some important and difficult points are not really justified or explained in details, but just given as assumption or obvious concept: If you are familiar with that concept, you will be fine (but probably won't learn that much), while if you are not you will be probably lost. I mean, for a free course this is already a pretty nice job, and I think it is worth to take this course. I would be for sure ready to pay something to get a longer and more detailed course on this topic.",3
99189,"It is a bit ambiguous the way it teaches a way to apply accountability, sometimes it is sometimes is not, it all depend on the circunstances.I recommend try to focus in the fundamentalsonly.",3
99268,"For beginners it's a 5 star course, once explains a lot of really too basic information and the instructor is more like a buddy than a teacher.Intermediates will literally fall in sleep, because of the excess of basic explanations and no intermediate or advanced explanation at all.As an Advanced, this course disappointed, not only because of lack of important information that not even in forums was answered, but it depends too much of the good will of mentors assistents.One big fall in this course is that's only in video, so no option to do it while in motion, like in a bus or any other noisy place.A bigger one is that's totally dependent of others students to give the grade, so you stay hostage of others and the instructor or mentors do not care about it.The biggest fall is that you will always pass it, once you can try some many times as you want, so eventually, you will pass, so the grade is just formal, not serious.The good side of the course, is that it seems to be very completed, so you will learn all the contents you need to work with AngularJS.",3
99569,"While I really enjoyed the first module, I was less impressed by this one. Have the course is very basic, while the rest is just too brief and not practical enough. I will however continue with the courses and expect the next module to build on the one reviewed here.",3
99575,Just wish to have some concept check before taking the quiz.,3
99579,There were some useful examples in this course. But overall this course and the entire specialisation rely too heavily on Excel which seems a bit outdated when data sets are so much bigger these days (than the ones in this course). Based on the requirements of companies hiring data and business analysts the expectation for anybody who wants to work in this field is in at least one or more programming languages.,3
99580,"Overall it is a good course, however, despite assuming minimal knowledge of Excel Statistical Modules, it offers little insight and practice. I would prefer a more in depth approach (for the advanced), or more exercises for those getting familiar with spreadsheets.",3
99581,"This course could work better as either a longer course with more examples, exercises, and step by step instructions in excel, or as a smaller part of the first and third courses in the specialization. The content is good and the examples are properly explained, but it probably doesn't warrant an entire course of its own",3
99583,It was not challenging. Could raise the difficulty a little.,3
99591,It is quite basic and sometimes the quiz can be a little confusing.,3
99594,A bit boring – way too basic. And I expected it to be a bit more systematic – simple (and quite fragmented) examples around one case... Could be a bit more.,3
99596,"Most suitable for people who have had very limited exposure to spreadsheets. Anyone that has spent considerable time working in Excel will find this pretty limited. The final portion of this course (Monte Carlo simulations) was the most interesting part, as it got into the more statistical functions and the Solver applications.",3
99598,"The course was useful, but the quizzes were frustrating. Whenever there is a write in answer for a quiz question, I know I will get it wrong. Even though I am certain my answer is right, it never gets recognized as being correct.",3
99601,The course covers all the necessary theoretical basica of statistics and modeling but isn't very helpful in terms of practical implementation.,3
99613,"Decent introduction course however examples are very simple as well as the models that are constructed. I understand being an intro course the content needs to ease people into the subjects however, more realistic and real-life examples are necessary to take the material from this course and apply it.",3
99616,The course does not make you learn spreadsheets in detail.,3
99623,The course is fine but very short videos and lack deeply explanations.,3
99630,too superficial in the discussed ideas,3
99645,Few tools on Xls has been shown.More extensive and complex problem are required on use of Monte Carlo method,3
99646,"It's a good course, with quite a bit for a newbie to learn. Would have appreciated more in-depth examples in the lectures though, as I often found a gap in the lectures and the questions asked in the quiz. Even otherwise, good stuff.",3
99648,"The slide set is too brief, was expecting more details with examples & visuals",3
99649,Good introduction,3
99655,Exercises should be better designed and I think that first week of this course and the whole previous one are too basic. They could be assumed for 99% of people and I think it would be a good idea to create an optional preparation module containing them. That would save time and perhaps open opportunities for more advanced material to be included.,3
99658,"This course is very brief and basic introduction to spreadsheets. It was surprising that the ""pivot tables"" was never mentioned in this course.",3
99660,Is not as bad as I thought at the beginning (the first two weeks). It gets better the third week. I think it needs some improvement though.,3
99661,Wharton's online MD can not have a course so poorly develop (lectures vs quiz vs material),3
99664,It was a good course. The quizzes should be corrected since some questions are ambiguous.,3
99665,"The lecturer was very slow, and some things were not explained very well (while very simple concepts were often over-explained).Also, I'm quite sure there were at least 2 errors in the weekly quizzes. One that comes to mind is a question that had identical options for two of the multiple-choice answers, but only one of them was correct (50/50 guess, more or less --- I had to take the quiz 3 times before I guessed right!).",3
99668,"Many errors in the quizzes made this course a disaster, although the course staff was eager to correct them as more complains in the discussions arrived. Being the second course in the specialisation, it doesn't actually live up to the expectations as it mostly covers the very basics of the excel functionality in terms of modelling.",3
99669,A bit too basic at the beginning.,3
99670,"Overall the course was good, but the quiz assignments need work. When entering formula's there should be more clarity. Formula's can be entered in many ways and even when right were often counted as wrong.",3
99676,"What to say about this course? On the one hand, I learned a lot which merits the three stars. On the other hand, the quizzes were very poorly designed. It took me the maximum three tries on every single quiz to pass and I did just barely. Hey, this is EXCEL, not advanced calculus! Also, there were questions on the quiz that weren't even covered in the particular module. E.g., on quiz #1, there was a question about ""objective functions"" which the instructor didn't explain until the last course module. There were times when I questioned my own sanity until I read in the course discussions that others were experiencing the same issues. Before presenting this course again, TEST, TEST, TEST the quizzes and answers!! And if you're not going to allow for a range of correct answers or formatting variances, then change all questions to multiple choice where there's (maybe) a fighting chance of passing. I am immensely relieved this course is done and I can move on to the next one in the specialization--hoping it's better organized as was the Fundamentals course that Richard Waterman taught. I was fearful that a course in Excel was going to doom me for the rest of the specialization. Last recommendation: improve the presentation materials. Provide more details for reference purposes. Okay, I'm going to go relax, now, to recover from this trying experience....",3
99677,"This course was very average to me. Compared to the first course in the specialization, Fundamentals of Quantitative Modeling, which was absolutely great.What I liked:Good info on the tools in excel that are needed.What I didn't like:Time spent on content that necessarily wasn't regarding models; the critical material was buried in videos and was very brief. More time should have been spent. Additionally the quiz questions were subjective at times based on what was said on video and the formula answers weren't correctly graded in many cases.This course could have been much better, maybe I was just spoiled by the first course.",3
99681,It seems to me like the course could have like 2 or 3 times more video concerning tasks required,3
99682,Good course overall,3
99683,"This course needs tremendous improvement. In contrast to previous fundamentals of quantitative modelling module, this lags in lot of areas. No clear explanations and the quizzes are worded super vague and filled with with bugs. I expected a lot under Monte Carlo Simulation. However, too simplistic example and explanation was presented. The topics were not introduced clearly.",3
99687,"The professor of this course expects you to read his mind too much, preferring to skip through explaining his reasoning for solving some problems, such as calculating risk with the Empirical rule. He also mentions subject in the course outlines which he is supposed to lecture about in the course but doesn't, or just expects you to learn it yourself.",3
99688,"A separate class for spreadsheets and modeling isn't bad perse. The best way to teach these models is to integrate them during finance or accounting, or whatever specific class you are trying to learn.That said this is probably a good resource for someone with 0 and I mean absolutely NO experience with excel. However my gut feeling also tells me that those who have had 0 experience with excel will not be able to follow the models shown in this class.",3
99689,"The exam answers were not clear.... The were questions not related to the videos. This was an excel course and no excels were available to download, just PDF. In the other two courses (Quantitative Modeling and Accounting Analytics) the excels were explained and available for download. This was an excel course and no excels available.....",3
99697,"Some of the SCRUM, XP & Agile Practices can be better explained. I have expected a few more things here.",3
99699,"Great methodology, timing and very good teacher.",3
99721,"The course is well structured and Prof Muppala presents it in an interesting way. The range of technology covered was good and would be useful. The CapStone Project timelines are not realistic at all - one has to start implementing almost from the word go, the artificial interim reports are distracting if one does not realize that and I think many students are forced to a second session to complete the course.",3
99731,"It's a nice course to review good work habits, but it mostly states the obvious.",3
99735,Good information for the absolute novice in time management.,3
99746,Great basic overview,3
99749,"This a decent course, perhaps something I should go back through and do again.",3
99758,Only for beginners in time management who know nothing about time-saving techniques. It is very easy and repetitive.,3
99759,I have not really improved TBH.,3
99768,"It was a short and good course. It has videos of good quality, short examples and talks. Every week it has lecture slides, articles about the week. But It was really short and contain too little information and subject. I hope that you will add more information. It was helpful to me and I hope that It help more to another students.",3
99775,Good course to hone time management skills!,3
99819,"Helpful tips, but this course should be free.",3
99832,Too basic and too easy but helpful content,3
99871,"There are some good tools to use, but the information presented it really just an overview and there isn't much substance to it.",3
99872,Good information and advice. I wish it was more comprehensive though. It seemed to just give an overview of each topic discussed. More detail would have been nice.,3
99880,It's quite a simple course. What I was impressed was the supplementary reading linked to an online article - you are not doing things by saving time but the time will save itself if you,3
99893,Better to provide real life case study example that shows how people using a particular system can really be more productive than before,3
99899,"It was easy to 'complete' the course, but I have failed to implement its suggestions. I think I will have a better idea of what to do once I actually follow the techniques.",3
99901,"This was an excellent course, but rather brief. The information was easy to absorb. There is a lot of value to taking the course.",3
99907,It could be better.,3
99917,"It has few content, should been more complete.",3
99924,very useful ; but can be more fruitful,3
99929,Need more hands on activities.,3
99933,More examples for different levels needed,3
99935,This course has help me a lot,3
99937,"It was interesting to learn on how to better manage my time, although was too theoretical.",3
99941,Not much usefull to the reality,3
99963,"it's a quick efficient way to know some trick if you are an absolute beginner, now if you have some knowledge or already read a lot of articles about procrastination Etc, it won't help you discover new things, or tips, it's a cool way to review it though. (There is no science talk at all here...)",3
99976,this course helped me so much in realizing and organizing my time.,3
99987,"The topics are all very basic and the audio/video is sub-par, but the course offers a coherent overview of the core topics of time management and several useful tools and resources together with a few pointers to relevant literature on the topic, such as David Allen's GTD.Applying all of the techniques presented in the course is a surefire way to enhance one's own productivity both at work and in the private life.",3
99990,"Easier than expected. Much was common sense, although it was well put together.",3
100015,It highlighted some bad habits in my life that I can try to eliminate in order to improve efficiency while providing better habits to replace them with. It's also a fairly easy course to complete (you don't even need half a day).,3
100016,"I think the best quality of this course is that it is a short course, which bolds the most important facts in our mind. It is not like that we don't know them at all, It's just we don't pay much or enough attention.I start using this method from today and I hope it goes well !You should try this course, I think it worth it !",3
100031,"A nice short course. I would have liked it to go a little more in depth. I don't think it provides more than a simple youtube-search could. However, the lecturer is very appealing and credible. Maybe there should be more in the ""suggested readings"" so people with the interest could add to their knowledge.",3
100033,A good course with good assignments,3
100040,It is useful!,3
100055,"The course is not bad, but I felt that it was just a collection of common sense advice.",3
100059,Honestly I really already knew most of the things in this course. It was nice though to receive it in a academic setting. Was hoping to gain a little more skill from the course.,3
100060,"Few good ideas, too much repetition of the obvious.",3
100061,"Good course, but very high-leve",3
100063,It do not not applies to everyone.,3
100075,"Good course, but a bit simple if you have any previous experience with or interest in managing your own time.",3
100076,I am thinking that the teacher can be a little bit dynamic and energetic.,3
100079,The presenter was good but the course was too basic and barely an overview. It needed to be longer to be worth it,3
100096,A few helpful tips but most of the stuff seemed like common sense.,3
100106,More interactive and dynamic videos would be bett,3
100110,"I would give this lecture a three because it is a very independent and useful course, but I feel like the presentation skills could have been improved upon and found the information very dry. I really liked the intent and where she was going.It was easy to follow and complete, although there was something missing for me.",3
100137,"So far, its good and simple, this course is for those who really want to make practical impact in their lives. So far so good!",3
100146,gave us many skills to save our time,3
100168,"The theories are perfect, but a little simple for those who have already known them.",3
100180,"This might be just a personal opinion, the tips given in this course are rather intuitive. I happen to use the techniques explained in the course because they simply seem logic. Still for unorganized people it will be useful, and is clearly and well presented.",3
100182,Lots of helpful information and tools to use were provided from this course.,3
100202,It is an easy but useful class.,3
100205,good and useful content but some problems in vids,3
100209,This course is for newbee only. If you already spent some time on topics like time-management or personal effectiveness you probably won't get a lot of new knowledge in this course. But for the beginners it is ok.,3
100213,"This is a very short, but useful and highly practical course. It will help you think about your work habits, as well as introduce you to an array of tools to analyze and make changes in whatever areas in your work or personal life you believe should be more productive/fulfilling. It's very light on the theoretical aspect, but it does offer you some food for thought. And Ms. Meloni is a delightful instructor -- she actually makes you wish the presentations were a lot longer than they are.",3
100250,Good course I liked it. Very useful,3
100251,"I found the modules repetitive and felt the course could have been shorter, but i did take away some useful tools and it did reinforce some good practices i was already doing.",3
100270,Good course,3
100271,It is a good course that gives you a general idea about how to manage your time.,3
100273,"It is a very short and informative course, but it focused more on professional life than personal life.",3
100281,"It was nice experience, but to be hones I expected more information about this topic and that is the only reason I didn't give 5 stars.",3
100298,"The teacher seems really nice and explains things really clearly, however the content of this course is not as helpful as I believed. It gave me a few new techniques to better administrate my time, but nothing that will revolutionize the way I work.",3
100315,"This class was more so tailored to those already in the work force rather than those in college, but it gave some helpful tips.",3
100317,"Awesome, straight to the point and full of great new ideas, I just wish it was longer",3
100335,Actually I think this course is a little too easy and not so informative.,3
100366,I think that's a very good programme and a professional instructor .,3
100369,"It's alright, but could be much much better. I didn't feel engaged and half of the time I was just wishing the video would just end. The course itself highlighted some good ideas about saving time and prioritising, but the way it was presented just fell short for me.",3
100373,It covers very basic concepts of time management.,3
100382,"It is definitely beneficial to a certain extent but I thought that it was a little dry. However I really enjoyed the time period of each video, as I am the kind of people that tends to get a restless when the teaching gets too long",3
100395,"The course is very basic, it should have more in depth topics or maybe it should be within a specialization of a complete research methodology, but thanks, this is a great help.",3
100421,"It's look very very basics, i thought to get something more informative..",3
100423,Nice course but lot of troubles are arising during the completion of this course. still i am unable to complete it and could not find out the reason. Once i got a message that my course is completed and i can get my certificate but now it says still assignment pending... i dont know how to deal with it.,3
100434,"The organization of this course was very good. I liked the themes and their order. I thought the videos could have been longer and more substancial, but the reading were great. I got confused on one of the assignments in which the questions of the given chapter were supposed to be answer. There were 3. I must have misunderstood or have another file, because no one I read had such question and I got not so great reviews. I think this should be looked at. Either way, thank you for this opportunity!",3
100445,"Content is good. I found the information in the videos valuable, albeit short and leaving me wanting more. I suppose that's what research is for. In general great and short course to get one on track with research methods.Take this course, as it is good.So why three stars?I know it is a long review, and feel free to remove it from the list, if you deem it appropriate. I have learned a lot in the course, and it is a valuable experience still.My problem lies with the design of the course, that seems to have started with great vigour at then lost the steam at the end. I would like to suggest few pointers. Especially since the presenters have another courses in the catalogue with similar issues.1. Help learners to focus - Body language, and position in the room. Standing in front of windows with the traffic outside may seem a minor thing, but it detracts form you and the content. As a course designer it is a responsibility to set it right. Same applies for hands in back pockets, posture when sat down, lens flare etc.2 - As instructors you have offered very little teaching. All was left to the guest speakers. All very good and knowledgeable. Some graphic and own mini lecture would help to establish you as experts (not that you are not, but we would not know that from the videos), rather than mere interviewers. (Summary of what was said).3 - match the video and e-tivity focus. And think about the accessibility of the material to your learners, especially if no previous knowledge is required. Week three was about managing research and planning. The reading, was surprisingly different (week 4 activity would be more suitable here) and really hard to access to someone, who hasn't done much reading in theories of knowledge etc. This would be more accessible as a guided lecture and quiz, rather than 400 words response.I hope I was not offensive to anyone. I was trying to help you to help us learn better, if that makes sense.M",3
100455,"Instead of interviewing different people, it could have animations and infographics to explain the research methods.",3
100479,"Came to know some basic research strategies. Enjoyed the assignments. Good course, catered for grad students but Undergrads can also benefit from the Reading material provided.",3
100481,The course should be renamed as Basics of Research Method.,3
100482,so interesting and they got a very talented way of teaching,3
100486,"Some parts were good but overall the course was lacking in its ability to add value. There were generic discussions. Week 3 was almost useless; had it not been for a good reading provided for an assignment, it was too basic.Add some specificity in the course or name it Basics of Research Methods.",3
100496,"The overall premise of the course is strong. Although I found the instructors and guest speakers extremely knowledgeable, quite a bit of the material was repetitive within in each week's video clip content.",3
100500,Helpful insight.,3
100505,"course content was great, but I felt like the course left me hanging....",3
100506,"It's great to understand more of research methods in application, but I wish there were more resources provided to supplement our study. In general, this is a good course for those who start thinking of doing research in the future",3
100514,"The course was of great help. It provides valuable insights to engage in academic research. However, I rate it only with three starts because I think it is too basic for the complexity involved in real research. Also I think some ideas provided in the course could be better organized. For example, in week three, the topic was understood to be something like ""Management Skills Applied to Research"" but the material pointed to something totally different. All ideas presented were great, but I think it is just matter to clarify better the objectives in each week.",3
100522,It is very short to feel like a real class. Video Lectures are too short too. I liked the readings.,3
100538,"I did like the course, it was informative. However, there didn't seem to be enough interaction with the professors themselves, and the grading by peers didn't make me feel like I really deserved the grade I got. The quizzes were also really easy, which again, made me feel like I didn't deserve the grade. It would be great if we could have at least one short paper graded by the professors themselves with a limit of words so it wouldn't take up too much of their time.",3
100554,"The course is a well thought and masterfully set of lessons on the main principle of journalism: it talks ethics starting from maybe old concepts that surprisingly are still fitting today.Being a basic course, it is very easy to follow and finish. Quizzes are alternating between very good and very bad. Tough ethical decisions and a space to discuss them is a really great thing, but peer grading two phrases essays with only the ability of telling yes or no doesn't make for a good use of the crowdsourcing the very course is advocating.The videos seem to have been made with an indecent knowledge of the technology, especially for journalists who are supposed to use it daily; green screens were used so badly as some parts of the professors ""spark white"", and slides are often cut away and put back in view while the teacher is talking about it, which was downright infuriating.It still qualifies for a very good opening course in journalism, but needs serious improvement.",3
100560,A little bit to basic and some informations are useless beause they are part of the common knowledge. I also find quite a few technical issues when trying it in the first termin.,3
100561,interesting and clear.,3
100576,"It is a good introductory course, but the technical aspect for this module is bad...",3
100592,really interesting but also really difficult to finish the assignment. it would have been great to get a sample assignment just to get an idea of how it could look like,3
100593,"Good course, but I think the previous courses of the specialization are better organized and structured than this one.",3
100626,So many valuable information in this course.But professor can surely present it in better way.,3
100639,Excel seems not like the ideal tool for portfolio optimization. A business plan or a net value calculation would have been much more in the spirit of this specialization,3
100671,"The writing instructor is great, and the ideas are good. I didn't like the interaction sessions with the other two instructors, i want to learn about writing not hear about other stuff or listen to some folks at a cafe. I thought it was a waste of time. Also, I didn't like that the example used was a memo for Coursera about their own course! They could have picked something more interesting. Good ideas, not ideal execution.",3
100696,"Interesting topics, however, still basic",3
100718,"If you are not familiar with AI, you can learn its basic ideas in this course. However, 1. No moderators or teaching assistants answer questions in the discussion forum. 2. No slides are provided for preview and review. 3. The lecturer is very good, but the contents are basic. More state-of-the-art, practical materials would help a lot. 4. Some vides are too fast to follow.",3
100748,"In my opinion, the final exam was weak since it was compacting the quizzes throughout the course. The content could be 50% theory and 50% practice which i consider that it was more theoretical.",3
100755,Interesting tha,3
100758,"The assignments should be flexible, i.e we should be given the score based on what we have answered and provided an opportunity to re-take them if we have to improve the score further instead of having a strict policy of getting all the answers correct in order to complete an assignment.Further the lectures were as though the faculty is reading out from a board in front of them (with an exception of Frederik Krebs), and thus many concepts were only touched on the surface. For people with not much background in organic chemistry understanding PEDOT:PSS and other chemical components we tough.A suggestion would be to increase the class duration and explaining the concepts in a more clear way.",3
100773,scarce material for weekly study,3
100775,"I love the scale-up part of the course. It gives me a great insight of upscaling of solar cells. But in general, the course is lack of content in depth. I would prefer a more hard core course with detailed explanation of the working mechanism of solar cells.",3
100800,"Too much practices and industries, but a little about the theory.",3
100805,"The course is a good introduction to Organic Photovoltaics. The instructors have done a good job to present a rather complicated topic in a manner that is accessible to a common audience.However, there are a few areas of improvement that can be noted for future versions of this course:First, All material is given equal priority in the course. I think what the instructor can do is to summarize the important ""take aways"" at the end of each video lesson. This helps the learner grasp the concept betterSecond, The explanation can be a little clearer - especially the topic of polymerization. Someone without an organic chemistry background, can find it frustratingly hard.Third, the tests are sometimes not in line with the previous video lessons and the reading material. The tests should be much much sharper.Fourth, the reading material should be improved vastly in terms of English quality, structure and presentation of key points. Sometimes, the learner can find it hard to understand some topics (ex: stability and materials) because it is inadequately explained. These topics should be explained better.Overall, a great start - but can be better. Well done and Thank You!",3
100880,"I gained a lot from this course, but perhaps not as much as expected even considering it is a fundamentals course. I had hoped to learn a bit more depth, rather than the few basic concepts actually covered. That being said, the instructor did mention at the very beginning which aspects would be skipped and which would be covered, and those covered were covered very well, with the possible caveat that the instructor tended to teach as standard methods that were her preference or background. Additional research on my own turned up a wider variety of PM techniques that were not even mentioned.Overall, worth taking, especially as a very basic introduction for those who (like me) had no previous PM experience.",3
100890,helped me to get some basic knowledge on Project Management process,3
100920,"I did learn the basics, but will need to go on and learn more in depth. I'd also like to have more written materials to go with the videos. I know I can download the video transcript, but what I'd like is actual handouts that are organized. I am more of a written/visual learner and need to read to retain information.",3
100931,very eye opening. videos were very clear and the explanations were clear,3
100969,hiits a useful course but its too basic.Thanks,3
100984,Its a very small and easy course,3
100993,A bit short and shallow. Focus is definitely on project planning and not so much on project management.,3
101009,"This course shares a lot of valuable information but could use a good deal of refinement. I really would have liked to have seen downloadable PDFs with the diagrams representing different models so that I could easily go back and reference them without having to find the particular moment in a video where it was shown. I also wish the videos were designed with better instructional strategies--the best Coursera courses (like those from Northwestern's Kellog School of Management) introduce material, expand on it, and then summarize the most important parts in each video--this helps the learner Here the learner is on their own. There's a lot of great information to pick up on, but some retooling from the UVA Darden School of Business would be greatly appreciated improvement.",3
101028,"The speaker was very difficult to follow with dialogue flow, random pauses, and stumbling over words. The rate of the speaker's speech was also very fast. The material was very useful, and informative otherwise.",3
101040,"Exams are not very good - some ambiguous, misleading or wrong-data questions/answers.",3
101060,Pros:Basics were explained well.A good kick start for beginners who are travelling towards learning Project planning and management.Cons:Wish we had assignments to practice MS Project to a certain extent.Some of the Quiz questions were confusing (Esp. the 3rd week quiz),3
101110,good closing course but peer reviewing and no prof is little untraditional.,3
101116,"Good to be able to apply the lessons from the individual courses in one, single project, but I missed having actual teachers to review my work as well",3
101120,"Even do the Research subject was very interesting, this capstone was a total disappointment.The Capstone did not offer very much support and the final review was performed for peers without previous knowledge and experience, receiving peer's complaints due to the fact that many got bad grading.Also, many peers complaint about the image of the Specialization Certificate for not being designed professionally and many felt that they petitions where overlook.",3
101124,"the capstone project had peer reviews, requesting you to consider executive feedback, otherwise i am not able to actually judge the quality of my work",3
101126,"Very nice and interesting subject. Updated information materials. Peer reviewing is not sufficient for grading a Capstone Project. A raw case + hands-on quizzes would help frame/evaluate the capstone project, instead of having a dedicated Wharton personnel to grade presentations.",3
101127,The peer review is not a good idea for this course. I expected to have valuable inputs from Wharton staff to my submission.,3
101154,It is OK but too broad to get actionable learnings,3
101170,"Useful. I feel some areas such as strategy, getting to MVP etc could benefit from more case studies and materials to work through. The overall content of the lectures is good but to internalise it there needs to be more 'work' for the students to engage in rather than just a quiz at the end.",3
101202,very simple and basic ideas of growing a business. case studies are a little bit outdated.,3
101220,Unfortunately I can not deal with the professors voice.The content is good.,3

101299,"The topic of capstone is great, but the milestones, and their APIs direct towards bad solutions.",3
101302,Good project but instruction is a bit draft. Probably because I joined their first ever one.,3
101317,"Too fundamental, too easy. No depth in math",3
101327,"As a guy from Machine Learning field, its models and concepts are so easy and simple for me, so it's lack of challenge.",3
101335,Course is helpful as a refresher to econ and business students who took some statistics in college. Someone who has never taken such courses will probably find this course much less helpful.,3
101336,"This is a quick run-through different types of distributions. I found it useful as a recap of things I learned in high school (!) and there were some additional insights. However, I think this course might be hard if you never did any more advanced (high school) math.",3
101337,I was expecting the course to provide insight on how to use spread sheet and its respective formulae in mathematical modelling.,3
101349,"It was an interesting module, however, not sure how I will apply this in",3
101350,There should be lab or hands one calculation exercise.,3
101353,It was theoretical but provided an apt understanding.,3
101404,"most contents are explicit on ppt, it is sometimes not necessary to view the lectures.",3
101405,"I believe this was a very good course for beginners. However, from Wharton, I would have expected more realistic examples. I would have also liked some hands-on assignments. But, otherwise.. Great, great course from a beginners point-of-view! Thank you so much!",3
101407,Basic but informative,3
101422,too easy. not enough practical skills or tools teaching,3
101441,the lecturer is kind of boring,3
101446,Felt a little rudimentary until the last week. I hope the specialization picks up after this point.,3
101467,"The materials in this course were great, but some of the math was not properly explained enough for the individuals to be able to see how the formulas were derived - especially some of the basic calculus and the regression materials. I believe it would have only added 5-10 more minutes in one or two modules to do so since there were so few examples given (This could be covered in subsequent courses within the specialization - I am not sure yet as I will be taking course #2 in the specialization starting next week). Otherwise, this course was a great overview of the types of models used.",3
101478,"Nice primer for modeling, but wish there were more workable problems to help hit the point home.",3
101483,I would have liked the quizzes to explain why an answer was right or wrong.,3
101493,"The lecture is clear, but it's a fundamental lesson which could not learn many things, just theories. Furthermore, I suggest that there should be solution hints for Quiz, because students will be frustrated by not knowing the answers and not knowing how to fix them. In addition, the discussion broad is a little bit cold and lack of mentors to help students.",3
101503,"A little too basic, but still good.",3
101506,"A good introductory course but it would have been nice to see a bit more of the math behind the models. I don't think the assessments were worth upgrading to the paid version of the course though. They were basically memorization and regurgitation directly from the lecture videos with very little, if any, thinking required. A bit disappointing from an institution like Wharton.",3
101517,please improve hand-out for self study.,3
101538,Assignments should be evaluated for all users (unpaid ones as well) like it is done for other Wharton courses.,3
101540,This course was a good refresher of mathematical and statistical concepts. I found the mathematical and statistical concepts applied to modelling interesting. I never knew that what I learned in high school in the past can actually be used to come up with models to solve business problems. Some videos were a bit long though.,3
101574,I understood the point that in script writing matters more than theory but I don't think that it's right that all marks I got I received from other with me with zero feedback from lectors and teachers.Definitely I wouldn't pay for sertificate but as first step and making some ready draft for further polishing the script this course was enough. So from one side it helped me to move forward with my idea but on other hand I didn't get any professional feedback and advices from teacher. There were some very useful comments from other students but I also need some help from people who are real professionals in it.,3
101603,"I loved the course and content, but, found the process cumbersome. I think that some of these issues have now been addressed and should not present a problem in future programs.",3
101608,"I like the course, it is pretty good to learn screenplay, butThey need to explain a little some topics that new writers maybe don't understand. Submerge more in some topics and explain it.",3
101631,"The selection of content is very good. Yet, the course requires solid amount of polishing. I had a feeling that the real teaching started only in the 4th week, with lots of walking around the subject in the beginning. Worth to mention that in contrast to the first 3 courses in Scala specialisation this one is very heavy on visual aspect. You actually have to see the picture, as the voice channel just references it.I can certainly recommend this course to people curious about data analysis. If you have had some experience and would like to try Spark or get better at it, then probably a good book can save your time.",3
101636,"This is a really excellent course. It deals with difficult content clearly, thoroughly and at a good pace. I would now be happy to use Spark in my work and feel I have a strong base to go on to further study. The exercises are well conceived covering fairly realistic use cases and are of about the right complexity. BUT, the feedback from the automatic grading really lets it down.The auto grading tests are at too high a granularity, each test tests too many things. They give cryptic errors such as '<some random element> is empty'. You have no idea why the element is empty as the students are given a different dataset to the one tested on. Moreover, the failed tests are invariably nothing to do with learnt course content, but trivial rounding/formatting errors. The forums are a lifesaver, but I still spent a good two weekends working on bugs once I'd got the assignments 70% right. I would not recommend to a completist!All the same, thanks to Heather for the wonderful work she's done putting it together and the excellent lectures she gives.",3
101644,"I understand that creating such a course is a tremendous amount of work. Let me congratulation the developers for all their hard work. I learned a lot. I'm glad I good the course, and I'm speechless that I finally finished it with a passing albeit imperfect score. This was the maiden voyage and it has some problems that should probably be corrected. That's my opinion.There were generally two sets of challenges with each assignment exercise (1) undemanding the scala/big-data component, and (2) understand what's being asked. Sometimes the comment in the code are wrong or misleading. In particular in the 2nd set of exercises. The functions are very poorly specified, and there are no unit tests. there should be one or the other. Without a specification the user cannot write his own tests. In addition the 2nd exercise is intended to be do-able, but not efficiently until the user views week 3's videos. Because of this the text output is EXTREMELY verbose, making it impossible to read the error messages and understand them. When the user finally submits the assignment it fails and the grader gives misleading error messages. A failing unit test should at the very least explain what the test was, what the measured value was, and what was expected. This is especially true when the user is forbidden from looking at the actual testing code. An additional problem with exercise 2, is that the student is asked to calculate a particular percentage, but it is not explained what this is a percentage OF and there are several ways to interpret it. I didn't realize until wasting 2 weeks that there was an alternate interpretation which I could try.In the 3rd exercise some of the comments in the code are wrong/misleading. Particularly with regard to classifiedColumns. comment #3 should read:* 3. other activities (leisure). These are the columns starting with “t02”, “t04”, “t06”, “t07”, “t08”, “t09”, “t10”, “t12”, “t13”, “t14”, “t15”, “t16” and “t18” BUT EXCLUDING those which are not part of the previous groups only. Otherwise the sentence is at best grammatically incorrect, and at worst misleading.Another significant issue with this ""Bit Data"" course is that it assumes a user understands data base and can construct sql queries. Well, such background is not a prerequisite, but the student needs such information to successfully finish the exercises. I can understand the temptation by the course developers to include a section on SQLspark, as this is a very powerful set of spark libraries, but I believe it is beyond the prerequisites. I could not have finished the course if I hadn't had an SQL/data-base expert in the same office, who I could pose questions to.I hope you find my comments useful.",3
101688,"Good information, but a little rough around the edges, possibly due to being its first time out of the gate. Should be amplified with additional weeks of topics, e.g. on Spark Streaming, etc.The Grader often returns opaque errors (""The Grader Failed""), when the actual problem was that the program ran out of memory or out of disk space. Grader can reject solutions, e.g. on the last assignment, if the programmer uses a different rounder implementation that returns subtly-different results, though the results print out as the same to the rounded degree of precision.The Grader should be written to accept results that are ""acceptably close"" to the desired result, e.g. if the desired result is 34.1, to accept perhaps numbers between 34.099 and 34.101 -- perhaps consult with other course-runners for best practices here.It might be helpful if the course provided a quick intro to running the assignments on DataBricks.Good first effort.",3
101690,"The course was interesting but it was clear that it is the first iteration. The course seems rushed, there are not very clear explanations on certain areas. Mostly, I had problems completing the assignments based on what I've learned during the lectures.The previous courses had difficult assignments and you had to think about how you wanted to do something, here the problem was using the Spark API and understanding things which weren't explained in the lectures. Also, not all the areas of the assignments were described.I am sure the course will become better in time.",3
101707,"The material in this course is very interesting. However, there were a few important issues:Lots of typos in the slidesLots of problems with the assignmentsAt the end, I feel like a beta-tester (it would be OK if it was clearly stated and if we had a discount).It could also be nice to add 1 or 2 weeks to this course.",3
101713,This course took a lot of work to create. I would have like more quizzes during the lectures and the assignments to have walk through the steps more. The best course I have seen online is the Machine learning course by Andrew Ng. https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome.I did really enjoy the course. Thank you.,3
101728,"Lectures are great. Explanation are very clear. Assignment was having issue like incorrect and/or vague reporting which made them needlessly painfull. I'm quite sure that the next iteration of this course can get a 5 star rating, but for now, it's only 3.",3
101736,"They do learn you about validation. But the spoken language is not that great and the steps are way to quick to do this in practice yourself. The help is also a bit shallow when doing the actual tasks. It's a good course if you want to learn about it and have a case as an example, not great if you want to simultaneously validate your own startup.",3
101742,THANK YOU!,3
101766,"It's a very basic introductory course. You can't actually expect much from this anyway. You really need to take the full course to evaluate if this is a great one. I did have learned something new but I'm not yet sure if it's useful or not. Guest speakers invited to this course do share some valuable ideas. For the main instructor, he's speaking really slow which can make you feel bored. However, it's reasonable when there is a big and varied audience on coursera because not everyone can hear a quick speech. I'm going to continue studying the course.",3
101793,"I thought this course could have been more engaging. I quickly lost interest when the second course module repeated a large amount of content from the first module--I think a better overview or editing approach could have fixed that. I also was disheartened with the ""just around the corner"" sales-pitch refrain in this course ""in your next course, you'll have access to..."". It didn't help maintain my interest in the course I was taking currently.",3
101804,"Content is really insightful, however, the instructor does not really dive into the details of most things. If you are paid learner, its better to get the whole specialization if you really want to get the gist of social media marketing.",3
101812,"This course in informative, but not very, and it is rather boring.",3
101837,"Very basic dive into social, feels like it was structured for an older audience.",3
101978,"The course is quite short (videos are usually only 3-7 minutes long) and therefore could be completed very quickly and/or need quite little time investment. I did not like that they do not have any written materials cause at some points they go over written slides very quickly and it is tricky to follow and understand. On the other hand, there is a lot of repeats and therefore you will understand everything in the end.",3
101987,"Decent coverage of the basics, but some of the data, tools and approaches used are out of date by 2-3 years which is particularly troublesome in the fast-moving social space. For example, they rely quite a bit on data from 2011 and 2012 and from social tools and reports from IBM.For someone completely new to the social space, this could be a great starter class. Just be sure to do your own research to supplement the data and be sure you're current.After grading assignments by other students, it was easy to see why the discussion portions of the class were flat: most either didn't invest in the assignments or didn't understand the materials. While I have found the discussion portions of other MOOCs to be equally interesting to the class material, I didn't have that experience in this session.",3
102003,This is a nice introduction to social media marketing with professional insight from Randy Hlavac. I felt the content was a little too basic though.,3
102033,the professor was a little bit dry and repetitive but otherwise the content was interesting!,3
102035,"An okay introduction to the specialization; hopefully, the future courses will get into more detail.",3
102038,"I would like more content from this module. It was very slow to take off, especially week one. It was easy and enjoyable though. I would have liked it to be more challenging.",3
102049,"Good introduction. But it feels like it is not complete. It is not much without the other courses so you either take the entire specialization or the benefits are not that big :(I feel like the specialization courses are an artificial break to a real university class... if the university class had only the content from those videos, that would not be enough.",3
102076,need to be more advanced even for a beginner.,3
102096,"This course is an overview of SEO and doesn't go into a lot of detail of how SEO is actually implemented on the site. What it does do is offer a snapshot of the industry as a job outlook, discuss Google's algorithm impact on SEO practitioners, offers interviews with current SEO analysts and experts, and describes how content affects SEO. I recommend taking the more practical courses in the specialization to get skills needed unless you're an absolute beginner and have no clue what SEO is.",3
102110,More on the history of SEO rather than tactics.,3

102194,Perhaps a bit too basic (and thus boring). But holding out hope it'll prove to be a good foundation for the rest of the specialization,3
102214,"Good information presented, but I can't get past the outdated teaching method of using the first 45 to 60 seconds of each video to talk about what the video is going to cover, then spending 30 seconds repeating those bullet points at the end of each video. Some videos are 4 minutes long, so more than half of the content is not actually content, it is essentially the instructor reading the outline for the upcoming content. It's a waste of both instructor and learner time. There are errors in the materials, and since there is no instructor feedback/interaction, there is no way to find out what was meant (including in reading assignments). All you can do is submit a ticket to get it fixed and hope that it gets corrected for the next people who take this course.",3
102229,I wish if you could accept the submission of answers without upgrading to enroll for payment.,3
102233,"Distracted, useless info and short (finished in 3 Hours)",3
102245,Nice intro course. A little light on content but I still learned a lot,3
102256,Student should be able to see results of test ( at least quiz 1 and 2) before we decide to purchase. Overall the course was easy to understand and follow. I look forward to taking to others in the series.,3
102260,Clear but a bit superficial. Hope the rest of the course will flesh out in more detail the various topics.,3
102298,"Just bare essentials , can be found online in other places for free",3
102326,Good course,3
102329,I am disappointed by not being able to do the assignments unless I pay for the course.,3
102372,Great lectures. I really enjoy discovering the world of the teacher and friends. I'll give it 3 stars since it doesn't arrive at an awe inspiring conclusion or life changing experience as somebody interesting into these subject would expect. The part where our own importance is challenge is enlightening. Cheers to the good professor.,3
102415,"The beginning is well prepared, interesting and informative, the end is undercooked, subjective and repetitive. Be it 2 separate courses, I would rate them 5 and 2.",3
102473,I enjoyed the course material and the idea behind linking Buddhist concepts with psychology; I just found some of the videos a little dry.,3
102539,Loved the professor. Do not like essay questions.,3
102609,An interesting class but left me wanting more. I realize that this is an overview but the field of secular Buddhism seems very shallow. After going through this class and reading three of Steven Batchelor's books I have the distint feeling that I may have reached the end of the subject.,3
102626,The Professor is excellent. I enjoyed this course solely because of Professor Wright. If you have a positive outlook on Buddhism but do not know the ins and outs of the religion/practice I do not recommend this course. I have a totally different outlook on it now that I wish I didn't have. It is interesting information but the essays are in depth and difficult...and there is no chance to even purchase a certificate.,3
102810,Nice but demanding course. No course certficate is available after passing the course...,3
102847,"interesting course way to feminized. It did not take into account that women can also be violent, if not more so. It only focused on the fact that men are violent and almost no discussion of women being violent towards men.",3
102849,Interesting for US-Americans or people who are interested in US-American Epidemiologics. Very US-centered,3
102850,Great course.,3

102875,"This course was not as good as the first course. I found myself typing codes mindlessly a lot and feeling the guilt that I'm not learning a lot from the app I'm making because there is too much coding going on and it's not clear what's more important. The final exam was too easy (almost a joke!) and it didn't help me figure out if I actually did learn something by typing out all these codes. I would like more lecture, snippet of codes and explaining what they do and have us fill out part of a code by thinking through as oppose to typing out the whole thing.",3

103052,"she can go in depth more and give us more and more information. but still, i like it.thank you coursera",3
103055,"Great case study, but the way to engage the audience might have been way better. Assignments were individual and it was very difficult to use them at full power, because they were quite boring. Interaction with other learners would be very beneficial in a form of group assignment. Videos are very boring and useless in comparison to incredible content in the first 6 courses of the specialization. Capstone should have been done by the same (high) standards as other courses in specialization.",3
103059,"A bit too much useless mumbo jumbo, that can be concluded in a few sentences. Good for those that are new to videomaking, and good for some classic movies mentioned in the course.",3
103071,"While I think the teacher is an expert on the matter, this course what somewhat less structured and clear as the other courses in the specialisation. The teacher covered a range of topics, but didn't provide clear frameworks or structures for how to deal with different issues. I've done the three prior courses of SEO in the series and they were extremely clear and have a lot of valuable tools and frameworks to work with. I would also have appreciated some discussion again about metrics in this course - specifically related to content marketing.",3
103073,"Overall a decent course to audit, but I think it was almost too repetitive and lacked a lot of substance. It would have been nice to really focus on great content types, versus share, share, share.",3
103092,"Interesting but not much of the science behind it was included, personal choice, but I prefer more why with my what. Good tools.",3
103095,Most of the information in the course are available online but still this course will help you align and organize your diet and exercise,3
103101,"Very good information and resources provided. Unfortunately if you don't pay for the course you have no access to the assignments. This is the only course of several that I have taken where this is so. Surely, those non-paying students could still submit assignments, it is possible in other courses why not this one?",3
103106,"This is a good course, I would just do some things a little differently, for example, I don't agree with weighing oneself daily.",3

103146,Some interesting parts but quality of visuals poor and presentation suffered,3
103179,The content is really good but the test questions are very theoretical. They dont test the understanding but the learning capacity of the student.,3
103185,"The course is interesting much to be learned and topics are open to much discussion. Some of the presentation need to be simplified and shortened. Repetitions tend to lose emphasis of the main ideas. Additional literature is welcome. But, to those of us whom love science and specially 'Brain mysteries' this course is a different perspective from those physiological or pathophysiological brain courses. Theoretical ideas of the brain are not easy topics; but it does make an interesting discussion. Thanks for the effort and the course is appreciated.",3
103200,I didn't expect all that math and equations in a course about the brain. But it was quite informative nontheless.,3
103258,The quiz questions were not clear enough sometimes.,3
103262,"I have some suggestions:1. Use consistent English throughout the course due to this is an English class.2. one ""upload"" button is enough in the assignment . . . so it doesn't confuse people3. Specify the minimum grade to pass the assignment if it 80%, then say 80% . . .However, overall the course is good, and I love learning other culture! Kind of a new experience for me. Thank you very much! ^_^ Xie Xie . . .",3

103343,"The content is really an interesting topic that I'm sure a lot of learners with enjoy. However, the way it is presented needs a lot of work. First, the slides are not masterfully made; proper word count and transitions are not applied. Second, the length of the lessons are not conducive to learning, it needs to be trimmed to shorter lessons or even be cut. Third, it is repetitive and there's too much focus on the unnecessary, the lecture needs to be reviewed. Cracking the creativity code is an interesting topic. However, the lessons were not presented creatively enough.",3
103348,"One of the best lecture series for beginners like me. Some of the statistical concepts should have been explained better, but once you get past that, you appreciate the logic in the trading system.",3
103350,Very factual. Hard to grasp and follow.,3
103351,"The course is excellent, but there is mistakes in quiz and the forum participation is null. Professor nor your staff reply the forums.",3
103353,A bit complex topics for just an introductory course.Nevertheless interesting explanation on CAPM and ABT.,3
103354,"the technicalities are not elucidated by giving practical examples in simple terms. For example, the FAMA FRENCH model has been explained thoroughly but not told how to apply in real market. Also , how to calculate the expected returns from a stock has been taught using beta , but whats the duration of the returns if one buys the stock in the middle of the year.( for example I calculate returns of a stock Q using CAPM and I get 15%, then how should I interpret this in the real market scenario where I am investing in the middle of the fiscal year.",3
103355,"Although it delves into key elements of trading where it really matters, course lacks explanation on some subjects. Course progresses monotonously.",3
103358,"The course is really interessant, I will like more practical examples to complement the theory.",3
103362,"Skillful instructor, but terrible technical setup, and plenty of faults in the lecture slides in the videos. Also the audio-quality is poor.",3
103408,"An excellent course for students that require, or want intricate detail on the subject. Not really designed for casual interest, more likely for the philosophy major. Presented very clearly and the discussions and material were interesting. Would have been four stars but the final quiz was excessively difficult.",3
103436,"Hoping that the next sections won't be so laborious and focussed on analyzing texts in detail. If you want to know how to do such things, then this would be a 5-star course for you.",3
103437,"Dr. Sinnott-Armstrong does an amazingly thorough and detailed job, and the progression of the course is well planned and well executed.I wanted to give the course a higher rating, but unfortunately, the good doctor's explanatory skills only served to confuse and frustrate me, the further I progressed through the course. Extemporaneous examples were unintentionally and unnecessarily muddled. There were numerous misspoken or confused terms that could easily have been re-recorded or edited. And the splicing between the old course and the new one is sometimes discontinuous (though, to be fair, they warn us about that at the beginning).Nevertheless, I would still highly recommend the course to anyone looking for a thorough-going university-level course in critical thinking, and basic argumentation.",3
103443,"A good introduction for ""beginners"", aka people who are not involved, educated or interested in public health, healthcare. Alternatively, seek another course because it is very simple.",3

103575,visualized examples? - good content but lacked engagement,3
103578,Very simple overview of the UX process.,3
103582,"This course is a useful if superficial introduction. The concepts presented are pretty basic, but foundational. The quizzes are very easy.The instructor covers the topic in a pleasant and clear way. I would, however, have liked examples of a more visual nature (show don't tell).Ironically, the course materials show disappointingly little concern for user experience or design. The slides look like they were thrown together in a rush and without much care for design or even spell-checking. The quiz multiple choice answers are laid out in an awful, confusing, anti-UX way. Someone should spend a few minutes fixing all of this.",3
103588,Easy to understand,3
103589,Lean too heavily towards theory instead of practice. I do think peer-graded assignments work better than quiz in term of UX lessons...,3
103628,Lack of examples.,3
103629,A little too common sense.,3
103630,"While the course is basic, the tests don't test user concepts (for example the order of the 4 step design process is asked 10+ times through the 5 modules)",3
103632,Good base to start building a site,3
103633,"The videos did not seem very interactive. The teacher just read the slides. Good as an introduction, but not very hand-on course.",3
103673,Not the best one on coursera. Included many details that are not really relevant and quizes just checked if you memorized it.,3
103674,Doesn't tell much about Android or iOS in detail except their features and comparisons,3
103683,Expected more technical details of this course. Seems like it is more for managers to understand what the techies are talking about.,3
103695,"Good lecture and educational.Extremely bad thing that is not offered and for free.same bad is that they are not try to explain more, (for students with less tech skills).In any case i am happy with the course and i will continue with the specialization, but regardless my decision to continue, my very fair rate will stay low, (especially for the fact that they didn't offer the course and for free).",3
103701,"the lecture gave industrial terms and key words which is good but it is mainly reading from the slides, no elaboration or illustration.",3
103713,"While informative I question the value of memorizing release years of os updates. Then again, it was an easy entry into the broader specialization. I think it is always a good thing to ease students in with a less challenging intro course much like a video game begins with an easy level and slowly gets harder.",3
103720,Informative summary of smartphone development and pertinent technologies,3
103726,It's a good explanation about the technologies used on smartphones but it mote a comparison of what we had and what we have now. It's nothing really new and fundamental for this specialization.,3
103733,"Good structure but a basic course.It´s a good compilation of information about iOS and Android.I think that some generic informations should be also consider on this course no matter if it´s iOS or android.Some videos explaining the features like (gps, siri, multi-core processor...) would be good.",3
103734,Will knowing the stages of emerging technologies help in the real world applications? There is no conclusion if knowing accomplishing anything.,3
103739,good introduction to smartphone,3
103741,"Well presented and clear,. however, the course is more a history of smartphone operating systems than emerging trends of the technology.",3
103793,Basic but interesting for novices.,3
103798,"It definitively could be a whole lot better, look and learn from Udacity's nanodegree.",3
103801,The contents are not updated to swift 3 and Xcode 8,3
103810,The course should have more programming assignments than just having simple quizzes. And please update the language for SWIFT 3.,3
103813,"Overall the course provides a good introduction to the swift language. However, this course is not suitable for completely new learners.",3
103815,very basic,3
103824,"An ok introduction to Swift Programming, but I can see people who do not have previous development experience struggling with this course. Also lecturers were virtually nonexistent on the forums to help with questions which is disappointing since it is a paid course which implies you are paying for their time and effort not just the certificate.Best advice for people taking this course is to get through the material as early as possible and give yourself as much time as possible to work on the project, don't wait till the last week to work on it.Would also suggest the following changes to improve the course and help people understand the material better:1. Have a programming exercise to complete at the end of every week to prove you have understood the material taught, a quiz alone with 10 or less questions is not enough. The course ramps up way to quickly with the project if all you have been doing is following the videos, students should be practicing and proving they know the work far more often.2. Provide a clearer project brief since it was clear many people did not understand all the requirements.3. Provide a video of what the final project should do in general to make it even clearer.Overall I didn't have a bad experience with the course, just disappointed that it was really bear bones, there were too few opportunities to prove your understanding, it was poorly managed and the lack of interaction from the lecturers a massive problem when they are being paid to help out, not just provide videos and forget about the students.",3
103837,Good course. Somewhat odd levels of difficulty. Like the weekly lessons are easy and then the wall goes up in the task at week 5.,3
103839,Covers the basics,3
103844,"The teaching content is not at the same level of what required to complete the final project, which frustrated the beginners and also stop me from finishing the whole course. What a pity!",3
103848,"The videos are poorly done, and it's hard to follow with practicing in a Playground at the same time. Also, some of the optional material, is required for completing the assessment, which a bit unfair. The material covered in the videos is too basic to be able to apply the principles to a larger programme.",3
103854,Enjoyed the lectures. I wish there would be more materials to practice with.,3
103860,"There are only a few hours of content across the five weeks. The whole course can be done in a single evening. However, if you try this starting from no programming experience it will likely be extremely hard to complete. Since the course has as a prerequisite that you can already code this shouldn't be an issue for anyone.",3
103862,"I think its good that its given reference material for further readings, but this shouldn't exonerate you from explaining the details of the language, if I wanted to learn swift from apple's documentation I would be there right now, not here, if I'm watching your course its because I expect to learn it here.",3
103873,"Thank you for the course.With all my respect to authors, I have something to say:I beleave all 4 cources in the spesialization could be combine to one. Looks like authors may invest more time and passion to it. I just skipped all videos with Parham Aarabi.",3
103887,"Far less staid than some of the more traditional academic teaching formats in this science field. I was surprised I actually anaged to get through the introductory module but by the end of the course I was less inclined to want to attempt the end of module project simply because the instructions did not really provided sufficient indicators that guided newcomers to the subject of programming but in this science field it seems that is the norm with many introductory programming courses.Maybe the people teaching have forgotten what its like to start at the beginning and recall a time when they thought surely there is a better way in which to teach this subject that makes the connection between theory and practice and the relative interconnection much like bitesize stepping stones links a more plausible and achievable option for those unfamiliar in the field of computer science. Not sure why this aspect seems to fall short in CS but for some reason it does.I should imagine this course for many people who are either familiar with the fundamentals of programming and/or aufait with CS concepts on the whole and have already acquired the necessary basic skill set / knowledge base of programming, will find the subject and teachings rather informative and a move forward in the development of programming languages as the format in writing programs does depict a much simpler approach when compared to other languages.Sadly, for a complete beginner to CS this, in my opinion, fails to sufficiently guide or assist newcomers in building the confidence to later embark on a project that draws on the subject topics taught thus far and to that end its a bit of a shame as it tends to dampen your enthusiasm if you are interested in the field of computer science as that lack of clarification on what aspects relate to what factors does not become clear so when faced with the daunting task of the end of module project you may find yourself non-plussed wondering which topic relates to which task in the final project?I am sure other people will be inclined to disagree with my opinion on this but this is, after all, just my opinion, after giving the subject taster a try, the end result for me, was that the teaching methods were good as they appeared more relaxed and format was offered in a far more enjoyable way of teaching/learning a subject that, I felt, attempted to invoke or entice people where an interest in CS had been sparked and was perhaps aiming to offer a route in which to build the foundations of a programming language but then by the final week it was a case of well we have thrown this information your way, its now up to you to decipher what you need to apply to the which part of the final project and is done so under the guise of problem solving.The latter being a plausible concept I would find perhaps more applicable later on in the specialisation as you develop knowledge/skills. But to be incorporated into the very first module of this pathway it seems doing so is, what it seems like most introductory programming courses invoke, and, is quite a leap to embark upon especially without first being offered stepping stones sufficient enough to feel certain you have adequate understanding to be able to sift through the information provided and subsequently decide upon which aspects are relevant in order to attempt to accomplish the tasks set that ultimately form to complete the final project.Its actually through being guided by the experts whose teachings highlight to newcomers through practical visual sessions where we actually begin to learn where these interconnections link between these chunks of informational topics - all of which form the essential fundamental building blocks - and in so doing, that perhaps perceived initial 'spoon fed' approach then enables a newcomer to build sufficient skills and knowledge to then be able to actually 'develop' their confidence. Without the essential basic foundational mixture how is it possible to engage newcomers enough for them to determine when they will then feel equipped to attempt a final project? This stepping stone approach is surely the most effective way to equip a person new to a subject field so they can then broaden their knowledge base. Alas, in CS it seems the falling flat on your face so to speak is a preferential approach to learning in this field of study.Its such a shame these highly intellectual people who create these courses forget what its like to start at the very beginning and the time it takes and guidance needed in order for a person to be able to feel like they are ready to dive in and give a topic like this a whirl. Like I said, its only my opinion but this is where the interconnection and building of the knowledge base falls short at an early stage of development.",3
103896,Need allot of improvement,3
103903,"Good introduction, it would be even better with a few more presentation on SWIFT.",3
103909,I'd like to have practice tasks during the course not only the final one,3
103912,I didn't like very much the two teacher,3
103937,The format and structure of this class needs some improvement. Having to write some code each weak would be better than answering quizzes and doing the first lines of Swift at the end of the class.,3
103942,"Went in a slow pace. Enjoyed the modules, especially final assignment.",3
103944,"The course was very well organized, but the main topics of the course were still covered. The lessons needed to be more structured and not so ad-hoc. The final assignment was peer reviewed, but the feedback (based on student feedback) was not very useful.",3
103978,"Somewhat useful, but suffers from what seems to be bad planning and a general lack of focus.",3
103980,This course really need examples in final assignment,3
103982,Professors talk too fast and in an English for those who do not speak often difficult. Extra Stress: swift and English,3
103990,"Tedious introduction, delayed second week. Hope that the following section will be better.",3
103996,"A resource if your starting with Swift. Video quality is often poor. Examples are a bit too contrived. Generally, presentations should be better prepared, too much figuring things out during the video. Good choice of project for the practical.Many interesting coding practice tidbits along the way but needs polish.",3
104005,"The material is OK, the video quality is regular and the instructors are childish. I prefer the Android specialization where the instructors are more mature and professional.",3
104036,Some of the evaluation methods just allow other people how doesn't do to much work to just pass...,3
104038,Hope recommend some more reading,3
104040,"I thought this was going to be a more comprehensive course about crowdsourcing and using social media to aid the design process. Maybe I missed something, but it fell a little short of the mark for me.",3
104055,The teacher is not very good at explaining things in simpler terms. The lessons were kind of hard to understand.,3
104097,"There was a lot I liked about this course, especially the weeks focusing on background and theory. However, about half the course focused too much on the software that could be used for systems analyses in public health. I would have preferred more of an overview of systems thinking and less diving into the nitty gritty of technology. The other systems course (Systems Science and Obesity) seemed to balance these aspects much better - and moved the technical aspects to labs.",3
104108,"I had rated the course earlier but would like to amend my statement. By some uncanny chance, I have just managed to pass the final assignment on my fourth try, which means I have passed my course. I still believe my original observations are valid. Thank you.",3
104181,Could have made it more interesting,3
104206,"The content from the instructor is very, very brief. Maybe this is just a simple introduction course but it also seems like the topics are covered in a very vague, abstract way with little exploration on a deeper level. The assignments are really good though, great projects for sparking the creative process.",3
104222,The assignments and theory are interesting enough to get you started on world design.,3
104255,"Easy to follow and well-packed with good information and tips, but I would like to see some kind of quiz-function along the course to test the knowledge I've been learning.",3
104257,"The course is fun but the content is too general. I like to know more methods and technics to develop a game world, considering genres, mechanics and gameplay options.",3
104259,"The course is ok, but it doesn't give any certificate of completition for free users (something that many other course do give).",3
104261,Useful but as with the first course of the specialization very light on content,3
104262,I wish the course would give me more structured information and examples of applications.,3
104270,"Short, simplistic. Could be done in a week. Very much a beginner's course for those who have not mindfully observed the game worlds in which they play. The student may come away with a few new ideas and the greatest value is in having peers review the homework assignments. Worth the time, if you quickly breeze through it.",3
104276,I am all for short videos but here it is a little bit too short... Tehchnically there is about 1h of videos for the 4 weeks of this course and no real documentations to review.Hence you get few pointers on how to design game wold for video games and really case studies in my opinion... A full review of one or two games would have been a great addition.,3
104300,"May be we need to more videos with good examples of the topics covered, I mean good examples that go beyond the basics about topics such as buffer overflow and cross site scripting",3
104305,The first three weeks are really interesting. The 4th and 5th are boring: it explains too many arguments in givin just hint to many of them. Many videos are too long and there are too many.In my opinion they should focus on fewer things and explain them in ore details. Many times the lecture becomes just a list.,3
104334,There should me more topics on secure code review methods,3
104335,The first half of the course was great but 2nd half was a bit disappointing.,3
104351,"Excellent content undermined by technical problems. The non-multiple-choice assignment (which involves analyzing a business plan) is particularly annoying. It requires uploading of screenshots but there is no ""upload"" feature is available. The assignment must be graded by ""peers"" -- which means, if you happen to take this course at a time when no one else is taking it, you're out of luck.Re: content, I would discourage you from taking this course if you don't speak fluent French. Indeed, you even need to understand how the French sometimes mis-translate into English, because some words in the answers to the multiple-choice quizzes don't exist in any English dictionary -- you will only understand them if you can guess what French term inspired the bad translation. The pace of lecture-hall-style discourse in the videos is such that subtitles will not save you if you don't understand French.These technical and minor content issues are unfortunate, because the core content i s really quite good.",3
104376,A bit disorganized and rambling lectures. Good content,3
104386,"Maybe if you're just starting out and using the same software as Prince Charles, this class would be more useful. Even so, the audio on this has got to be fixed, especially since this is an audio class about mixing!I learned a few vocal layering techniques, but this is a really beginner class and is very DAW-specific; if you aren't using the specific software, the information here will only be valuable for topical concepts. Because if this, watching the videos aren't much help visually, but then it's an uneasy listen because the audio levels in the videos are so uneven, that you can barely hear the professor's voice on a common speaker, and then you get BLASTED when he turns on an audio clip.The way he explained things also felt a bit slow and dragging to me. I teach young children, and it seemed reminiscent of the way I have to talk to them sometimes. Then there's this really awkward and long interview with his musical colleague (week 4) who didn't seem to know much about what he was being asked, and while watching their conversation, it's totally apparent in the professor's face that he wasn't getting the output he wanted from the guy.Thanks for the vocal techniques.

104647,"Eh, not great to be honest.",3
104677,"I thought the videos and interviews were great but I would prefer these separated from the lectures on tangible material. I kind of feel like the course was rudderless and just gave some headlines and then said to go figure it out on your own, but be inspired by all of these extremely successful people. I would like to see the course get into more depth, for example where to start on market research. Where to start on budgeting, and how to go about developing some of these specific business aspects. I enjoy shlmo's lectures but just wish some of this course ""zoomed in"" to me and seemed too ""zoomed out""",3

104751,Concepts weren't explained properly. The instructor was going too fast.,3
104752,Material was interesting. Did not enjoy the teaching method of Prof. Caffo. Very scripted and skips way too fast through some of the equations and R code he's trying to teach.,3

104765,"I'm in the data science specialization. Statistical Inference was my 6th course. All of them have been on a spectrum of good to great. But Statistical Inference is a mixed bag for me.First, if you are thinking about this course, take some time reading the other reviews. I find many of them resonate with my experience leading to 1/5 stars.One reviewer who gave 5/5 stars said they loved the course. They suggested that other reviewers who gave low ratings are ones that dropped out. I don't find this to be the case. Many of the low rating reviewers actually did pass the course and said very similar things as those who did not pass the course.Another reviewer enjoyed Brian's dry humour. I must have missed the jokes after watching each video 5 times...For the record, I almost aced this course. The reason for not getting 100% was because I was so annoyed with one of the quizes that I didn't bother taking it again to correct it. I decided living with 8/10 correct questions was better than having a stroke while in the pursuit of two extra points. Yes, that is how much I hated this course.The first 2 weeks of the course were the worst. I dropped out for about a month (because of life priorities). Then I couldn't get motivated. 1 month turned into 2 months, then into 3 months. I basically took the entire summer off. Finally I bit the bullet and completed the final 2 weeks. The 3rd week of the course wasn't actually all that bad (though the quiz was terrible). The 4th week felt like the first 2 weeks...terrible.(By the way, it's a mistake to take such a long break. I had to re-watch the first videos to recall things for the remaining quizzes).If you don't have some sort of statistical knowledge (or inherent aptitude), be prepared to work four times longer on the course. For all your quiz and assignment time-to-completion estimates, multiply them by 4 or more. Seriously, I spent probably 10 hours on the final assignment which said it should only take 2 hours. Each quiz took me an entire Sunday afternoon (My partner was not pleased).Now here is where things get awkward. I hated the course .... BUT....I learned things that actually stuck. So in THAT regard, I give this course extra stars. It accomplished something that some University courses could not. I even found myself USING the new knowledge in real world problems. So ironically, is that not a sign that it's ...dare I say...a GOOD course?Would I take the course again? I actually might, but ONLY because of its place in the overall certification. If you are a prospective student wondering if you should take the course as a standalone course, I don't think I could recommend it, because there are far better ways to learn. In fact, just doing the Swirl lessons could be good enough.If you are a prospective student and you want the certification, then you'll HAVE to take the course. Why are you even bothering to read reviews?So I'm giving the course 3/5 stars. If I gave it 1 or 2 stars, my review would be clustered with the majority. If I gave it 4 or 5 stars, I'd be lying.",3
104766,Learnt many new things. It was good.,3
104779,"This is of course my personal opinion, with all due respect for the Tutors. Plus, it has to be noted that I am writing this as a Mathematics graduate, and this course was most probably not meant for people with any background. However, I have seen similar opinions from people like me. Probability calculus and statistics are both enormous areas of mathematics. Introducing them in a 4-week course seems a really bad idea to me. The probability part was in my opinion far better than the statistical, the origin of every new concept was clear. In my opinion, the optimal solution for the course would be to create a separate, longer course in PC and stats and require knowledge of the two for taking Data Science Specialization.",3

104805,"The course is a very quick run through of basic statistics and not very intuitive for people without much statistics/maths background. The swirl exercises is a very good practical learning tutorial that supplements the course, but overall it still lacks on the conceptual aspect. Personally, I have to occasionally refer to other basic statistics materials to be able to follow the flow and understand the lectures.For the course project, there is a huge discrepancy in what the project expect the students to perform and the peer grading criteria. As a basic statistic course, the correctness of the estimation/ calculation/ assumptions is integral in any analysis but the grading criteria mostly neglect all this aspect. Hopefully the course admin can rectify this aspect of the course.",3
104806,"To be honest, I like the subject but found the course material and content not very well structured. I missed more mathematical foundation.",3
104807,"It felt like there were a lot of jumps between basic statistical formulae and abstractions thereof. While I don't think it was inappropriate for a course on statistics in itself, it felt rather out of place in the rest of the sequence of this course.",3

104850,"The course is good, but not very challenging. Anybody having done any course in statistic would have little to no information from the first two weeks.

104950,The course was very dry compared to the other courses I have taken. Though there was a lot to cover in the four weeks but this was not best way to do it. The course covers a lot of concepts in far too little a time span. It should have been spread into at-least two modules.,3
104955,"I think the theory is too dense, but with a weak link with R. I understood better with swirl than with the videos. I'd suggest a more organized video with less draws and annotations. They confused me sometimes.",3
104972,As someone who isn't from math background many of concepts thought in here weren't quiet clear or intuitive. Could use more details or pointers to reading materials to help understand the concepts better,3
104974,"Since it is a very theoretical subject, trying to explain it without proofs and plenty of background is hard. But i feel like most of the course is just to memorize formulas without much explanation where they come from. A few examples are computing the expectation and mean of the average distribution and computing confidence intervals.",3
104976,"Not one a statistics newbie should take, had to take it twice just to grasp 80%",3

I understand that a lot of content is covered within a month, but there should be supplementary course material available. Moreover, TAs should be more active on the forums.

In several cases, I had to use external sources to understand the content and/or derive it by myself. When I finally understood the content I couldn't understand why it is presented in such a cryptic manner when the concepts are rather simple to grasp and the math not so advanced.Professor Caffo is a good communicator in some occasion (the module on Power for example was incredibly well communicated). But most of the time he just throw us some result without properly setting the context and concepts, as if it was understood that we already know most of what he is talking about. (Not the case!)I plan to make a document that follows the course module and fill in the missing piece of contextual information, derivations and concepts. But this takes a lot of time. If/when it will be completed, I will try to find a way to share it with future generation of students. Because, honestly, the content of this course is not so hard and shouldn't be!",3

105119,"The course was more about CSR and philanthropy of businesses towards society which was not what I expected as the course topic as very vague. Having done an MBA in business I as expecting more in-depth teaching on strategies of various business and how their creation of value to stakeholders.The course is short and very appropriate for beginners but not in-depth knowledge, however it still does create valid points on businesses role towards society at large.Lastly I did like that all course material for all weeks were opened and thus one could progress through the course faster",3

I was extremely disappointed that after laboring through 3 long stories, only one formatted in the way the course specified, and trying to write at least one page of comments on each that what I got in return was on good critique and two that were only two lines long. I was on scholarship so I did not pay for the course but it was disappointing that there was no moderation of the peer review side of the homework.",3
105154,"I learned a lot from the exercises in the other parts of the specialization. To make the capstone a better experience for everyone I propose that here the reviews should be graded. Perhaps, only have each person do two reviews instead of three but have them submitted as part of the next week's assignment and rated. Everyone could rate two or three reviews. This way reviewers would put in as much effort into the reviews as into their submissions, and they would also learn how to write reviews by reading other reviews and sanding examples.",3

I know better now how to approach assessing a story and critiquing it, and I really want to work on a story of my own next!Not going to lie, though, this course was difficult to immerse myself in simply because of the examples: I'm not into guns, not into muscle, not into violence, and every single example was either of men, or how a female's mission centered around the men in her life. If I could suggest a change in this course, it would be to consider all the different backgrounds of the people taking the course, and give examples that are more inclusive.",3

The videos seemed to present a lot of painfully obvious information, however, and I'm afraid they were not terribly engaging. Maybe just too much/too long? A shorter version of the course that digs in a little deeper somehow might be more alluring.",3
105865,"Very good course, I enjoyed it very much and appreciated the educated and polite style of Prof. Jeffrey Sachs. I would have appreciated a copy of the figures and grafique shown. The course release in 2012 would need to be updated. The Quizz need a real involvement of the student to be completed; challenging but I personnaly appreaciated very much. The Quizz would need some profound revision since some links are not available anymore and some answer are simply wrong. A Statement from the Columbia University / Prof. J. Sachs would have been welcome since completing the 14 week course imply a real involvement from the student. Overall very appreciated course, Thank Prof. Sachs!",3
105894,"It gives a well based numeric approach to sustainable development, but fails to approach some subjects from an ethical point of view. At some time, Prof. Sachs points out a few numeric indicators that favor economic development, but when talking about reaching these numbers, he offers more than debatable ways.",3

105958,"Good practical examples of the concepts. In general, seems to me that the courses of the specializations do not fit together well. At times, basic things mentioned elsewhere are repeated, some others are not explained sufficiently.",3
105992,This course is much more informative than the previous two in my opinion. I liked the sample spreadsheets provided. I still however feel the price is a bit steep compared to other similar courses you can find online. The quizzes aren't that challenging and it may be nicer to expand the assignments to practice more.,3

106000,Lack practical aspect analysis. Most of the materials are more theoretical (some of the graphs are not necessary and does not help understanding the discussing topic and increases confusion.

Some questions are presented in lecturing or quiz, and answers are hardly found. So, some text books had better be specified.Homework of this course is quiz-based, only one optional programming task. It's easy to pass the course, but it's hard to master its content. As an application science area, more practical assignments should be provided, as can help students learn better.This is a 6-week open course teaching a complicated research area, Natural Language Processing, so most of its topic cannot be discussed in detail. However, this course could be designed and organized better.",3

106554,"The lecturer's style doesn't go with the nature of a MOOC. By using his book as the notes for lectures, he doesn't give himself a chance to prioritize content so it's kept clear in the exposition. His favorite word is uh-um. In a classroom (face-to-face) situation, the lecturer is likely to see and react to listeners' look of confusion; in a studio he is just talking to himself. He repeats points -- this can be good if done smoothly but it's very confusing when the lecturer is inarticulate, like the present case. It's really too bad because he clearly has a lot of knowledge that could be used to popularize thinking about the unwritten constitution.",3
106575,"I gained much from this course. However, the final assignment is quite difficult to complete for students with no access to data on companies and industries. Had that been readily available (without an exorbitant fee to data providers), I would have rated the course with 4 stars.",3
106579,"Overall, the contents are too fluffy and not very tangible. I appreciate though putting the tools into action and having to work on the competitive position assignment, it provides great insights on what matters in a competitive market. As an optimization proposal I suggest to cover the resources of week one, like terms and formulas. That is much more crucial than some of the fluffy contents. Also the companies discussed during the course should not be more known global companies (like Redhook, or the food market examples), hence not to restrict it to USA.",3
106682,"Very informative and rewarding. Professor is very energetic and shows he is totally involved in the course. The major problem with this course is that, as complex as it is, coupled with the lack of access to the instructors to ask questions, perhaps the assistants could be more responsive and helpful with problems students are having problems with. It makes no sense to learn without knowing where one is making mistakes and how to correct them.",3
106691,"Introduction course to other courses, not much to learn here. And also some quizzes question were never addressed on the content.",3
106713,"I don't like that the 3 and 4 star reviews are missing!Coursera seems to sometimes remove reviews with lower numbers of starts.I thought that this course was going to be mostly on the brain, but it wasn't at all.... just a small section.If your main interest is in vision then it might be different, but for me being interested only in how vision relates to the brain, there was very little useful information in this course for me.",3
106721,"It was a good course but kind of vague. Lectures were too long and full of talking instead of pause questions to keep the learner involved rather than just listening. I hoped if there were assignments and games to keep us more engaged and to assure that we fully understand the content. Otherwise, Professor Maurice Schweitzer did a great job with providing engaging examples in each video and I got to know a lot of new stories worldwide.",3

106767,"The course is interesting and the self-reflection activies are great opportunies to learn about yourself. However, the course is very short. Each week takes less than 1 hour to watch and it feels like an introduction of an introduction. If you love to learn a lot about something, I don't think this course is for you. However, if you want to take time to learn about yourself, it's great.",3
106775,"While the information is certainly good, and I enjoyed listening to David Hill, it is too basic for me. I was looking for something that wasn't an introductory course, but I took it thinking the peer reviews would be worth it. I had a difficult time downloading peer writing to review, and I never got any feedback on my assignment. I also went to the forums for discussion, but there wasn't anyone adding new information. It seems like a ghost class without any real live students. Since it is not interactive in any way, I am just spinning my wheels. Not worth the effort.",3

106872,"Good videos but strucural info and help. Unfortunately , for me it wasn´t very exciting or motivating and perhaps that is because of my own interests.",3
106901,Its intresting but often feels repetitive and more like advertising.,3
106908,"Far too basic in content. It's clearly aimed at people with next to no experience at all on writing and publishing! However, it still is insightful and inspirational as, 'Writing for Young Readers' is taught by two established children writers and, packed with interviews of other writers from all around the world. A nice introduction but, just that -an introduction. If you have experience writing (for children or else)",3
106923,"This course should be given a basic or starter level tag. Some of the videos are great, but they cover very basic: things like genre and narration. I thought the presenters/teachers were great, and I liked their author interviews. I wish there had been more writing assignments. I am very glad I took the course.",3
106932,The interviews and course discussion are invaluable in this course.,3
106938,I enjoyed the course but I would prefered it to be longer. I found the second part more useful.,3
106939,"I want to give it 3 1/2 starts - sometimes the modules seem really segmented and you spend half the time repeating the same ideas or recapping the course material (that was new that week!).While the assessment tasks were great exercises, the fact that they're peer-reviewed means that the feedback you get is often unhelpful or poorly informed.It was a good course to do, but I don't think it's really going to change anyone's life (and I would encourage people to not take the peer feedback too seriously!).",3
106955,"I loved the non-UK / American basis for the writing and the study texts: fascinating reads and great eye openers to other styles and languages. Such a rich source! The videos and interviews were great and I loved the transcriptions - they made life so much easier to make notes and annotate from.The main issue I have is with the 'peer' marked work throughout the course. I feel this was meant to be a collaborative tool for us to use, but instead turned out to be a rather awkward device. Some students gave leeway to the 500 words limit; others not. I was failed because my explanatory note - not the piece itself, just a note for context - took me 34 words over. How pedantic was that reader? Another piece I read was over 2000 words long and had obviously been taken from some other assignment: it barely fit the study brief. Additionally, are non English speaking students penalised by having to write in English? Grammar and syntax in the west is very different depending on the country you come from - German syntax vs Italian vs English. All are different. How can I be fairly marked if the reader of my work has English as a second / third language? By that same token, can I really pass a student who has met the course criteria, yet has mis-spelled many words, has little or no punctuation and has jumbled tenses all over the place. This needs to be sorted out I feel, as it has marred this course for me. I don't feel it gave an even playing field to all. Thank you for the opportunity though, I did enjoy it!",3
106968,"It is perfect for beginners, but if you're an experienced writer you might be looking for something a little more challenging.",3
106994,"The course addresses quite precisely and pragmatically every aspect regarding young athletes anatomical and physiological development. All the information provided in the lectures is research-based and Dr. Brooks states clearly when she is providing information which needs further investigation or clarification. The lenght of the lectures is short and these are very well organized by modules, facilitating the learning process. The information is almost always related to its application to young populations. While the topics covered by the course represent a fair amount of the information a coach should have, psychologycal and social aspects, which are quite important for training young athletes, are not convered in depth. The assessments lack effective feed-back to support the learning process, given that after taking the quizzes you will only know if your answer was right or wrong, missing any instruction about the course content itself, and the only peer-assessed piece misses a feed-back section which may help to improve future writing.",3
